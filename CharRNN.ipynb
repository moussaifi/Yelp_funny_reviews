I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.\\n\\nI'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a \"C\" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room. \\n\\nMmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me. \\n\\nThe jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty. \\n\\nThey provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special. \\n\\nNot gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don't recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day.</td>\n",

The best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older Polish and Hungarian women. \\nThe biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors. They are like plump pillows of softness. You can buy them buy the dozen. You can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat. The warm ones are served with butter and onions.

So try to eat it fresh while there if possible.\\n\\nIf one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you, go for it, as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money.  I wanted what I wanted, though, so I ended up with a medium, thin crust, regular crust pizza with jalapenos, pepperoncini, onions and feta.  It was pretty expensive at $2/topping = $20 med pizza.

Let me explain...\\n\\nThere are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. \\n\\nFOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? \\n\\nI'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  \\n\\nI ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. \\n\\nA few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. \\n\\nSERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. \\n\\nI won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.\\n\\nService: 4 stars\\n\\nKitch: 4 stars\\n\\nFood: 1 star</td>\n",

       "['I love chinese food and I love mexican food . What can go wrong? A couple of things . First things first this place is more of a \"rice bowl\" kind of place . I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats . The ordering was a little confusing at first but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2 - item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk) . I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side . I m gonna admit this place looks kinda dirty . I do not think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside i would give it a \"C\" grade lol . We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food . We took it to go and ate at our hotel room . Mmmm . . . the food was just alright . The jade chicken was nothing special . It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken sesame chicken variant . The hengrenade chicken although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken was still pretty spicy for me . Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy . If you are not sure ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering but it was way too spicy for me . The jade chicken quesadilla was decent but nothing special . Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese . A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald apple pie . If you order the burrito be warned that it a burrito for gnomes and smurfs but he said it was tasty . They provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent again nothing special . Not gonna lie the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside . I used the bathroom like 5 times . I do not recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day . ',\n",
       " 'If you are looking for the best pierogies in Pittsburgh this is your place . There are a few small tables outside but most of the business is carry out . Pierogies Plus wins Best Pierogies every year . Why? Because the owner is from Poland and she is making the real deal pierogies . The best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older Polish and Hungarian women . The biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors . They are like plump pillows of softness . You can buy them buy the dozen . You can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat . The warm ones are served with butter and onions . It definitely a comfort food . The best part is that they ship internationally . Yes they are that good . ',\n",
       " 'So good ! They did not make it to 5 stars due to the prices are a bit high for the amount of food and the location is a bit unsavory . The decor and atmosphere was surprisingly nice from the outside I expected to be more run down inside . The staff was very nice . We were surprised how empty the dining room was for a Friday evening . We got Vegetable Samosas to start then ordered Chicken Tikka Masala Lamb Rogan Josh rice and plain Naan . Our only complaint was the lamb could have been more tender but everything was flavorful and delicious . I would definitely go again if given the chance . ',\n",
       " 'While the prices are a bit high for a make - your - own pizza the taste makes up for it . I love going to Seventh Street market sitting Not Just Coffee and having a drink while waiting for delicious fresh made pizza from Pure . I have taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market and I can say that the pizza does not do well reheated . So try to eat it fresh while there if possible . If one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you go for it as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money . I wanted what I wanted though so I ended up with a medium thin crust regular crust pizza with jalapenos pepperoncini onions and feta . It was pretty expensive at $2 topping = $20 med pizza . But it was delicious . The arugula salad with goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette is to - die - for . I crave that dressing days later . So light and fresh but flavorful . ',\n",
       " 'OVERALL : The food is not good (I explain below) but this place may still be worth locals time (and more importantly money) . Let me explain . . . There are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town . We do not seem to value frequent patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time . I think we should . Even when the food is not show stopping . Why? This place has tremendous character and charm . There an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor . Established in 1955 it the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas . Its a throwback to a rugged carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades . And still exists . I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor offers . FOOD ISSUES : So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great . It really should be great . But they are not putting enough care into the food . I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare . I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made I would be in the medium range . My instincts were correct . But the steak was closer to well done . In total three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked . In a steakhouse . With a man tasked with grilling the steaks . Sigh . The fourth steak smoked prime rib was cooked properly . But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red - meat - eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? I will tell you . When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it . But the chef was not watching the meat . He was not even in front of the grill . He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors . And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived . So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention . I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak . Both were fine . But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it because the rest of the meal is so mediocre that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal . It was just OK . The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough butter and three types of cheese . A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good . After tasting it I was grateful to have passed on this wet mush . SERVICE : Our waitress was very attentive and responsive . She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks . I wo not be back but I m glad to have visited this historic spot . Service : 4 starsKitch : 4 starsFood : 1 star',\n",
       " 'When I compare Over Easy with other places maybe I do not find it my ultimate Sunday morning family breakfast place but I would definitely drop by with my pals for some home - style fries once in a while . . . Everything is what you would expect from a $10 - $15 breakfast and that why I gave it 4 - stars . The waitresses are really nice and friendly which is the kick start of a good morning . Go with \"The Big Breakfast\" for ~$12 if you are hungry and I m telling you you would be pretty full by the end of it you would not want lunch ! ',\n",
       " 'We usually go to Lindo Michoacán when we want Mexican at a sit down restaurant but I felt like we were just there and talked my husband into trying Juan . Ok we are hooked ! Service was great . We got the Fajitas for 2 with Steak and Chicken add cheese . . . so good lots of flavor . Loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite . My only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left I smelled like I had worked the grill my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy . I had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down . I will just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here . Prices were on par with other Mexican restaurants and you get more than enough to eat . We will definitely be back and we will be packing the Febreeze ! ',\n",
       " '4 . 5 StarsAn extra star for the legendary Iraqi fish dish known as Masgoof . If you are a fan of fish dishes this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in Iraq . An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste and is then placed in a 45 - degree angle by a charcoal fire . Traditionally large freshwater fish are used but at chateau the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish . The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable . It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof . In most cases I find kabob houses to be boring and that is not because I do not love the almighty Kabob it because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East Detroit and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2007 where I was in kabob paradise . However Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope . Here in Washington DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there is not a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor is not particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars . Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs . At Chateau the spices are right the juiciness is on par and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob . And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice ! It is superb here - fluffy velvety and aromatic . The interiors and décor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I have come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man . It appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually DESIGN the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes . Some aspiring Middle Eastern Restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space . I m glad the guys at Chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish the delicious kabob and good company makes Chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in Montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs . Hats off to the owner and chef who are always in the restaurant tending to guests - some of the nicest people you will meet . ',\n",
       " 'I have been debating about writing this review . I love cupcakes and I was so excited when I so this store . The store inside the mall is very cute . The staff is amicable but not overly helpful . Which is ok the cupcakes look good however looks are not all even for cupcakes . I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut as well as a Key Lime cake pop . I tried the cake pop first . It was gummy tasting and neon green . I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime . Then I took a bite out of the coconut one . The cake per se was not bad however the frosting tasted like oil . Not appetizing . So I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry . I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town . Again the neon yellow color for the cake . Where do they get these citrus . (see picture) The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store . I ended up throwing them in my garbage making sure to smoosh it down in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this) . At least I know I wo not be tempted at the mall anymore . I guess I should be thankful????',\n",

I have had the opportuniti to dine in get carri out and order deliveri (I will stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you wo not be disappointed . The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice . The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good and I would know since it been a staple of every single order I have made with Lucki since . It always hot with the perfect combination of sour and spicy and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp . The large order feeds 2 perfectly . The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order but Lucki version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor . They also were not shy with the egg on the rice and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain that pleased me . I have done a mix of delivery and take - out many times since and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before) and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry - out order . Of the items I have ordered those times the curries have been phenomenal as has the spicy eggplant entree . I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I have had similar dishes but I usually gobble it up so fast there no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it absolutely delectable . I m also a huge fan of their brown rice option even though it $2 extra . Lucki brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it . I m pretty sure it not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice . I also really liked the Rad Na though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it . It truly shameful . The only order I was not completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe . The flavors were nice but the beef was tough and chewy . A simple misstep which I can forgive . I have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far : spice consistency . I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go - to at other Thai joints but did not find them spicy enough . I have now settled on an 8 which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow . Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8 it had literally ZERO spice . It actually might have gotten into the negatives . It quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9 - 10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan . WHAT S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?But alas the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci . Sorry I could not resist . ',\n",
       " 'I have been a fan of Pita Jungle since my ASU days when I lived down the street from the Apache location . Now I live in the Arcadia area so this is the one we frequent . I have not noticed a huge difference between the two locations same great food same stoned servers . My usual is the Portabello burger . The balsamic marinade they use is fantastic . The presentation is a little messy but once it hits your lips it so good . I pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it pretty amazing . Everyone knows the hummus rocks . I love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro . It like a little hummus sampler for less than $5 . The service can be spotty especially when it comes to drink refills but I have surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly . I normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled but I have had some BAKED servers here so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive . So good job stoned servers . Maybe work on the drink thing though . ',\n",
       " 'BRFC is a solid place to try some really good chicken . I have been very happy on my recent visits to BRFC . Our chicken combos were tender juicy crispy and flavorful . We like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces . My husband and I really enjoy it and plan on returning . Pros : * Friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter * Clean and modern decor with plenty of seating table options and large windows* Large TVs (we watched football during one of our visits) * Combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw Fries : skinny crispy salty and plentiful | Coleslaw : a bit bland for my taste* Their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning . Their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun) We do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming * Their Boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable* Their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable* Milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken* Honey Dipping Sauce options : wildflower chipotle and wasabi honey flavors I LOVE all their honey options for my chicken tenders * Other Dipping Sauce options : habanero hot sauce and their own BRBBQ barbecue dip* Lunch Box Special Deal : M - F | 11am - 4pm | 3 whole wings fries and a drink = 8 bucks Cons : * It seems a bit pricey for what it is . Essentially it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint . You are looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos . However I do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints . It an upscale atmosphere for a fast casual restaurant . Review 1 for 2017',\n",

       " 'I have heard great things about Toast for breakfast and lunch so thought we might get it a try for dinner . . . We walked in around 6 :30pm on a Friday night the restaurant was about half filled . There were plenty of seats in the the front of the restaurant but our party of four was seated in the very back beside the bathrooms and back door . We sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat) but we really could not take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits . We politely ask if we could move to the front . The hostess obliged but did not seem too happy about it . The same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table) . We were brought a loaf of soft bread to table pretty tasty but the butter is a little different . It is a sweet butter with orange zest . We were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish I happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli . I ordered the mushroom ravioli my husband the lasagna our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat) and chicken Marsala with ravioli side . The server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us . . . . . . so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side . When our meals came out they served him ravioli he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back - um okay would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered . He was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom) . I was told by my friends that the chicken Marsala and chicken pot pie were good . My husband lasagna was good but very rich ! ! I could only eat a couple bits he could not finish it . My mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless . The cream sauce was very watery . I did not enjoy my main dish at all . On the bright side though we all got salads and really enjoyed them . I had the small blue wedge salad . It was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top . Really good ! Our server disappeared while we were eating our meal . The lady who had been refilling our waters took over our table and closed our checks . As we were leaving we see our server sitting behind the bar playing on his phone and chatting with other guests . . . . We probably will not be returning to Toast for dinner . It just seemed way to pretentious and we were not impressed by the food or the 93 . 5 sanitation grade . ',\n",
       " 'If you looking for the good customer service stay away from this restaurant the lady work from here never say hi to the customer i went this restaurant yesterday i was so surprised her rude attitude to customer i asked her to about seat and she said \"just go seat any where ! \" I still dont know why she answer me with harsh tone voice',\n",
       " 'My husband and I drove by Rani a couple weeks ago and he said \"International Market? That looks interesting . \" So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later . After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed \"$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there ! \"So that is how we wound up at Rani . I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I m a sucker for paneer) and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited . She brought out our thali which consisted of 2 roti rice dal pickles okra an aloo - gobi - type yumminess and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings) . The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it . Definite bonus points . Everything was fantastic although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha . This place is very casual which I really like about it . Do not come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit - down Indian restaurant ; instead expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma kitchen . After we filled our bellies we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store . I had not planned on buying anything but when I found garam masala for super cheap and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and could not find and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6 - $12 for a tiny jar anywhere else) . . . . well you get the picture . Anything you would need for a well - stocked Indian pantry is here and then some . There also mint and tamarind sauces bottled lassis naan and huge blocks of paneer . Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home . I considered giving this place 4 stars because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time . But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted . . . . So obviously I cannot blame them . ',\n",
       " 'We were searching for a local Peruvian restaurant and found this place on Yelp . It was the midafternoon so the atmosphere was subdued . Some may refer to this place as a \"hole in the wall \" but the antiquated interior was much more conducive for large groups than their former location not too far away . During our visit the green - colored décor included a large mural blue - checkered floors TVs and three rows of tables stretched across the dining area . Santi and I started with the Ceviche de Pescado ($12 . 95) that came with slices of tilapia stacked and marinated in lime juice spices lettuce yam red onions and Peruvian corn . The tilapia was fresh nicely seasoned with lime juice without it being too overpowering . The spices were nicely embedded and accompanied well when eaten with the sharp onions and sweet lettuce . The Peruvian corn and yam were delicious too . At first I was concerned about the portion size but the fish turned out plentiful and worthwhile . We then shared Pollo Saltado ($11 . 95) made with chunks of chicken sautéed with chopped tomatoes french fries red onions cilantro mignonette and soy sauce and a side of steamed rice . The profile of the sauce was on point to bolster the flavors of the chicken . The red onions and tomatoes also nicely contributed to the profile of this dish . The fries were tasty fried to perfection and I was glad the cuts were on the thicker side to soak up the sweet - savory flavors . I only wished the fries were cooked down a little more with the onions and tomatoes . It met my expectations . The Seco de Res ($13 . 95) was made with stewed beef loin in cilantro sauce green peas and served with fried yucca salsa criolla and Peruano beans . The beef was very nicely seasoned with wine and other spices . It was nicely stewed tender but also had lots of dry spots . The use of green peas gave a nice sweet dimension to this dish . The salsa criolla and fried yucca also have some textures and sharp bites to the refined beef loins . We both loved the Peruano beans . It was nicely cooked down subtly sweet and flavorful . We were also given a side of roasted Peruvian corn with aji sauce . The sauce appeared more like a chunky salsa than the creamy smooth type I usually find in restaurants . The flavors were far - reaching but there were a number of limitations worth noting . First unlike most Peruvian restaurants Tumi does not offer fresh bread as a starter for the meal . Secondly service was friendly and courteous throughout the meal . But for whatever reason the server personally wrote the tip into our bill before delivery it to our table an act I find unusual offensive and disrespectful . Ironically we were going to give her a bigger tip until this happened . The server did however give us two coupons for $10 off each time we return to order at least $15 worth of food . Given the nice gesture I was willing to give her some benefit of the doubt but it still negatively influenced my rating of the experience . Interested diners should know that Yelp currently has a $10 for $20 deal at one voucher per table . I would be interested in returning to try their Anticuchos Ceviche de Mixto Cau Cau Aji de Gallina and Chaufa de Camaron . ',\n",
       " 'I have been here date nights or causal wine sipping numerous times since they have opened not even a month ago . I m very impressed with The Sparklings . I waited months and months for it to open and even asked \"when are you opening\" to a construction worker once :)It is truly amazing the remodel that was done inside of this building . The inside used to have private hibachi rooms for goodness sake . The ambiance of the former sushi joint is now an updated and posh Martha Stewart worthy lounge . Whatever the hell that means I just made it up . Sounds weird huh? Just look at the pics it truly lovely . The chandelier that everyone takes pics of and talks about is magical . The menu is a more causal (Sage like) menu . Modern American Fusion? Who cares about the title . It just good food . We have not ordered entrees here YET because we have already had dinner or were on our way to dinner on our visits . They said that they can accommodate to vegan for us no problem . I look forward to a pasta or a special custom creation . The items that we have had (so far) are very good . Portobello fries flat bread salads . . . . wine wine and more wine :)The service is super accommodating almost too much service . I guess because they are newer they want to help and help a lot . Lol . The over - service was only in the dining area . In the lounge the service is perfect . I truly love the way the did the garage door in the lounge and the way the patio area looks . I really want to sit in that left hand side back lounge booth with a ton of people . It really soooo big it could fit 10 + + + people . I love it . Their left side dining area private table would make a large gathering super fun . I will update when we order full entrees and remember to take more pics since we are here soo much . Just go it a marvelous addition to the beautiful SW area . I am proud to be a regular . Oh and hubby said no I could not redecorate our whole house like the inside of The Sparklings :((((((( ; ;)',\n",
       " 'I need to begin this review by stating : I hate Brussel sprouts . As a child my father would serve them to my brothers and I but we did whatever we could to avoid them . . . hunger strikes at the dinner table temper - tantrums or simply slipping them into a napkin and pretend to have finished our meal . As I grew older I was open to trying them again since my taste buds evolved to enjoy vegetables like broccoli and beets . Unfortunately Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor . When ordering at Dorothy 6 I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes . My burger came with fries but my boyfriend meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts . My burger was simply perfect - juicy pink and filled with flavor . I could not have asked for anything better . Perhaps that what made me feel adventurous . . . I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend Brussel sprouts . . . I was in love ! How could this be? My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts . The thought of them would make me gag in horror . Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6 I crave them ! Where have they been all my life? ! I would go back to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace Cafe for many reasons : great beer amazing burgers pierogis . . . Now Brussel sprouts are added to that list . Thank you Dorothy 6 for changing my mind and mouth about Brussel sprouts . ',\n",
       " 'Was dragged here on a Saturday night after a birthday dinner . I knew things were bad even as we approached the entrance . I could hear the music blaring from down the walkway and when we walked in I felt like I was going deaf . The DJ they had was cranking his levels to obnoxious extremes and with the sterile decor the sound was bouncing in all the wrong directions . It did not help that the DJ was terrible to begin with . The bartenders ranged from jock - like dudes and cleavage - heavy women . All of them seemed slow at their jobs and were too consumed pouring dozens of shots and making fancy drinks to get any of us a simple beer . We drank pints of Kronenbourg which tasted really off and quite gross . The washroom situation was one I wish I could have avoided : a bunch of drunk dudes waiting in line and hitting on any woman who happened to be waiting as well . I let a couple girls go ahead of me in order to avoid the onslaught of lame pick - up lines . The crowd was a mixed bag . My girlfriend said the only people who go here are people who already live in Liberty Village which makes sense seeing as I do not see why anyone who lives elsewhere in Toronto would specifically make there way here . We stayed here for about 30 minutes . Terrible in every category . ',\n",
       " 'A nice small breakfast spot located across from Siems eye center and Dr . Tran office . I m not familiar with this area so it was difficult for me to find this place . Came here for late breakfast . The waitress (blond lady) was very nice and cheerful . She suggested me to get roasted pork belly benedict . Korean boiled eggs caught my eye so I decided to try that also . She said Dr . Tran always order Korean boiled eggs when he here and it delicious . My food came out in 25 to 30 min but it was nice that they give complementary chips and salsa . Roasted pork belly benidict . . . Delicious ! Poached eggs were perfectly made . Roasted pork belly was exactly like \"Char siu\" you would get in some Ramen shop . Very fatty and melt in your mouths . I was expecting to get muffin type bread but the bread was like french baguette toasted very hard . I could not cut with the knife so I had to pick it up with my fingers and ate it . Korean boiled eggs . . . When I saw \"Korean eggs\" on the menu I thought of \"Korean sauna eggs\" which you would get in Korean spas (they roast eggs in hot sauna for hours) but completely different thing came out . It was exactly like \"Nitamago\" or \"Ajitama\" you would get in any nicer Ramen shop . Perfectly done sweet soy sauce flavored Nitamago . I loved it ! It was nice for the chef to come out and talk to every customer that was there . He was a very nice person . He explained me how to make perfect Nitamago (well Korean boiled eggs) with vinegar and stuff . I do not know if he a owner chef or head chef but I hope this place gets a lot of business ! ! ',\n",
       " 'My gf suggested we eat here because they have \"better\" food which I suppose is implied by the higher price they charge for dinner . This is not the case . When you are in Vegas (or anywhere really) you have to remember that a buffet is a buffet is a buffet . Sure they have got Kobe (not really we are not in Japan) beef lamb sushi Alaskan king crab legs snow crab flank steak shrimp cocktail . . . . . . but it all tastes like buffet quality food which is a better way of saying they are mostly terrible . Do you know how difficult it must be to coordinate a meal big enough to feed hundreds if not thousands or people? Do you possibly think quality can be a factor in cooking these meals?Where is the satisfaction in getting a thick slice of Kobe beef if it so tough your knife cannot get through it?Like king crab legs? Then you will hate them here since they are all machine - cut partially frozen and it tastes like they have been sitting in a salt water bath for a week . I would not even mess with the sushi . I m very very picky about my fish and whatever they were serving here looked one step above the grocery store . Even the desserts were mediocre . If you want to eat well in Vegas go look up a decent restaurant and drop the $70 you would spend here there . This last (and I do mean LAST) buffet visit proved once and for all that no matter what they are serving or charging nothing beats paying for freshly made food . It is not worth cramming sub - par servings down your gullet just to justify the cost of what you paid to get in here . Unless you have no discerning tastes or you are just a big fatty who loves to binge eat (hey no judgment here . . . do your thing) then this just is not the place to waste money in Vegas . ',\n",

       " 'Woof woof *pant* *pant* *pant* woof woof (I will get back to this) . Keeping it real this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant . Words like fresh farm raised organic are replaced by outta bounds awesome righteous slam dunk mack daddy . The flavors are very bold bordering on over the top . Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment . Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs . For \"shareable\" respectable \"sashimi won - taco\" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli) . Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish . The \"fondue dippers\" are bizarre . Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of oil stabilized provolone sausage and tomato . Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home . On to the sandwiches and burgers :\"Come Rod . Come here boy . Sit . Awww that a good boy . Now shake hands . Awww Rod a good doggie\" . Contrary to what my ex might say I m not a dog . I do not expect my meal to be tossed on a plank burger falling over only half on the bun toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure . A \"big dipper\" features tender slices of prime rib smothered by melting pepper jack cheese topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive bitter horseradish . Impossible to pick up grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef . The \"off - da - hook smash burger\" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet excessive bourbon bbq sauce . They claim the bun is brioche honestly the sauce kills the taste buds . Finally the \"mac - n - cheese bacon burger\" Cloying greasy way over the top . The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat . A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections . Props for service . Fast and attentive .

The most tender and juicy fried chicken I have had to date the waffles crisp and flavorful . I prefer my fried chicken to be full of spice but this was an excellent rendition ! A bit spendy but worth the go ahead with the large sharing portion . Mama Chicken Biscuits ($14) : Free Range Fried Chicken Pepper Jelly House Pickles & Buttermilk Biscuit . Incredibly fluffy buttery sweet biscuit with lightly battered chicken moist and flavorful . Recommended ! I could eat these biscuits for days :DLow & Slow Smoked Chicken Salad ($16) : Haas Avocado Warm Cornbread & Yogurt Dressing .

Deviled Eggs ($11) : Fresh Dill & Smoked Trout Roe . Well balanced and fresh the roe adding just a hint of salt to finishChicken Liver Toast ($5) : Grilled Country Bread Cuke & Fresno Pepper Relish . Mildly mineral in flavor the acid in the relish complimented well . Florida Heirloom Tomatoes ($16) : Toasted Peanut Hummus Basil Smoked Tomato Sorbet Field Shoots Crunchy Puffed Ca .

Interesting combination with the citrus I enjoyed the pudding mango jelly light and delicate . Crunch & Munch Bread Pudding : M&Ms Bread Pudding Popcorn Ice Cream & Candied Pretzel . Incredibly sweet the bread pudding was thick and rich almost brownie - like . A bit too sweet for my tastes but one can figure that out reading the ingredients .

But if I have to have fast food you can do worse then Arby . On a positive note Arby usually get my order correct and they offer some not to greasy options . I particularly like the beef and cheddar which is a little better than most offering as a drive through . The beef and cheddar sandwich was hot and fresh and what you would expect from an Arby . However my fries were cold tasteless an old as if they have were sitting there for quite a while The customer service was fine but the closing of the store was not entirely diffrent issue .

       " 'So about a week and a half after having some of the best BBQ St . Louis has to offer (Pappy for those in the know check my prior reviews) I was back in AZ and ready for some . Having a week off and several friends who were fellow fans of BBQ I decided it was time to make the trip over to Little Miss while I was able to get there early and not have to wait long . Got there about 10 :30 and by 11 :10 I had a nice plate of juicy meat in front of me ready to go . Lucky enough for me I came on a thursday which meant it was Pastrami day and a platter full of that fatty brisket beans potato salad and an extra housemade sausage for good measure I was ready to indulge in all the essentials for BBQ . I have to say I was blown away by the flavors and the tenderness of the meat hear . The pastrami was incredible with a blend of spices that was out of this world there was a distinct subtle sweetness that I could not put my finger but it was a hit probably the best I have ever had . The fatty brisket was just killer as well with a great tenderness and ton of great smoked flavor . The biggest compliment I can give these two meats is that while I tried them with the various sauces I preferred them without and I am usually the type to slather my BBQ in some sauce . The homemade sausage was really good as well and work getting with some great flavor but was overshadowed by the others . The beans are more liked pulled pork with some beans added in other words outstanding . The potato also did not disappoint . One of the staff also noticed my buddies 2 young children were not eating anything when told they were picky eaters he said \"let me get the a rib to try kids tend to love them\" and he was nice enough to bring a rib for each youngster . While the kids still did not go for it after a little test bite the rest of us decided to try and they were very good and fall apart tender as well . In the absence of the Pastrami I would pair the ribs and brisket in a heartbeat for a great meal . The finishing touch was the pecan pie which while small is rich enough it should be shared but it will go quick as the smokey sweetness and flaky crust is perfect capper to a great meal . Compared to Pappy I may actually give the edge to Little Miss because of the Pastrami but it neck and neck on ribs and brisket so the end result is that AZ has a BBQ spot that can go toe to toe with some of the best in the midwest . Do not miss out and make the time to come here . It worth the wait . ',\n",

Which is something I look for at buffet services . He definitely an awesome server . Request him if you can ! As for the food they have a sushi area with a variety of rolls and nigiri it delicious ! You can also make your own hand roll ! Just ask the person behind the sushi station . They also offer caviar ! FAANNCYYY ! Lol first time trying it it definitely a texture to get use too . They offer prime rib which is juicy and warm pink which you can never go wrong in having ! For the seafood loves they have crab legs . UHH YUMMMM ! Crab legs were easy to break off and the meat was soft juicy and meaty (depending the leg size) . Their dessert section is pretty bigg ! They have all kinds of cake slices variety of macaroons cookies fruit tart donuts ice cream anddddd it goes on and on . Haha But other than that I definitely enjoyed my dining experience here . I walked out super stuffed and satisfied . will be back ! ',\n",

       " 'I have visited this location several times over the last few years and have always found the breakfast food to be good by the standards of most trendy breakfast places in the area . But the best? Not quite . Personally it kind of hovers between the 3 and 4 star range for me . Scrambled opts for the \"do it yourself\" approach to dining . You order your food at the counter and they will bring it out to you . You are pretty much responsible for everything else including silverware sauces napkins and filling up your drink . Not that there anything wrong with that approach . I m just not exactly sure what it is that you are wanting me to provide a tip for? Anyway . . . Whatever you order if it comes with hash browns upgrade them to their \"scramble browns \" which are probably one of the best creations they have . It traditional hash browns with cheese and bacon mixed in . We order it every time - without fail ! I usually get the two eggs (scrambled w cheese) that comes with bacon bread and upgraded scramble browns . My girlfriend prefers their strawberry French toast which I have never really been all too impressed with - as it basically just the addition of some strawberry cream cheese . We usually do not go to breakfast during busy hours but prefer visiting in the early afternoon to avoid the crowds . With most places this is rarely a problem but something was definitely off in the kitchen when we arrived 30 minutes before close . I received my order immediately while my girlfriend never did . Apparently they had forgotten about her . When she finally said something I was practically finished with my plate . To top it off the order they gave her was incorrect . Mistakes happen and they took care of us in the end but the mishap did seem odd considering the place only had a handful of diners . Be warned that servings here are pretty small . With what you pay in comparison to some of the other places do not expect to take anything home . The breakfast although slightly overpriced and undersized is still above average in comparison to many places in Phoenix . Maybe if I were a vegan vegetarian or anti - gluten I would rate it more highly . The dog - friendly patio is a nice addition . It worth a visit if nothing else . ',\n",

       " 'Over the weekend my friend and I had intense cravings for burgers and fries . Did a little search on Yelp and BAM - this place shows up ! This place is situated at a random plaza right by Eglinton and Maingate . It always good to find a hidden gem so close to home . *YAY*Their burgers are I - N - C - R - E - D - I - B - L - E . Not only were their patties unbelievably moist their burgers were loaded and definitely unique . I would say their burgers were a hybrid of Five Guys and Burgers Priest . Five guys because of the moist handmade patties and Burgers Priest because of it uniqueness ! I ordered the Apple Butter Burger with Masala Fries . While my friend ordered the Loaded AK - 47 with stacked supreme . Everything was delicious ! Safe to say I devoured everything in less than 10 minutes . This is definitely my new favourite burger joint ! The only reason I m giving it a 4 stars is because for one they only accept cash (which sucks btw ! ) and two I asked for a side of mayo and they charge $1 for a little container of mayo . What? Really? McDonald does not even charge for mayo or any of the other local burger joints either . . . Hmph ! **Oh update - the mayo on the website says it 50 cents not $1 . Yea yea I know I m pouting over 50 cents lol . But still . . . I could have gotten two containers of mayo instead of one ! ',\n",
       " 'Gah ! This place is always such a disaster late night . See also #iamold . On my most recent visit I had to elbow my way to the bar and wait forever to order drinks . Beer selection was meh so I went with a margarita . It was sickly sweet - - if I had not watched the bar tender pour in tequila I would have sworn it did not have any alcohol at all . After said drinks I was ready for a visit to the little girls room . Line for bathrooms stretched almost to the front door . One of the ladies in line with me said it was taking so long because girls were \"doing blow\" in there . If that does not capture what a classy place this is I do not know what else will . Oh wait ! Maybe this will help convince you . . . While there we watched a man being carried out in a head lock by 3 bouncers . He was bleeding from no less than 5 different spots . Once booted to the sidewalk he stood around literally gushing blood onto the street while the cops that seem to be permanently stationed out front tried to clean him up . Never again folks . Never again . ',\n",

       " 'Thank you Joyce for writing such a great review . We finally got up here to try Elvira over the weekend and are so glad we did . The first thing I noticed was how clean and sunny the restaurant is which makes for a pleasant atmosphere . They had some music playing but not too loudly and there were some fantastic aromas coming out of the kitchen . We did not want to get too crazy because we had to run some errands afterwards so just stuck with the oxtail lunch ($10 . 99) and the stewed chicken ($8 . 99) . I opted for the coconut rice & beans and my husband got the white rice and stewed beans with his . First thing the meats are so tender and flavorful I cannot even begin to describe them . I do not know anything about the seasonings they use but together they provide very warm flavors that create perfect comfort food . Then the next thing you have to take some of your rice and put it in the broth that comes with the meats so it can soak up those wonderful flavors too . Oh my God but that was good . A couple of maduros and a cup of potato salad come with the meals as well . I love maduros and do not get to eat them very often so they are always a treat . The potato salad was nice and creamy and eggy just like grandma used to make . They also had conch soup on the daily specials board and when Elvira overheard me say I forgot to order some she brought us a little sample with rice to try . That was delicious as well . Dining here makes me want to learn more about the seasonings they use . That was our first time here but it definitely wo not be the last . I look forward to trying the other items on the menu .

       " 'This place is unprofessional in every way possible . It really a shame that for a place that serves up very decent authentic indian cuisine that the customer service is so deplorable . My parents and I went in today to pick up an order of undhia and bhajia at 6pm . They had pre - ordered it and arranged the pick up time . We were told to wait for 5 minutes which we did with no problem . 5 minutes turned into 10 15 and almost 20 . When it finally came out my father rightly expressed concern about the timing since we were ordering a very large amount for a special event . The owner snidely replied well if you are so concerned then why are you even ordering from us? Ummm say what? First rule of customer service the customer is always right . And even if they are obnoxious which we were not you APOLOGIZE for being late . And you do not make snide comments . And here the kicker we let it slide because there were other people in the store and when we got home we realized we had gotten the WRONG order we had 2 orders of bhajias . So we called the owner Hetal to note this error . Instead of an apology (at this point we were owed two) we got her adamant denial that she was in the wrong . No it was us who had placed a wrong order . My father expressed his disapproval of her behavior and you know what she said? I do not have to listen to you I have opened restaurants before I do not need to be told how to run it . UM actually you do . Because you are RUDE UNPROFESSIONAL and cocky enough to think that just because your food is good you can get by with the worst service I have ever encountered . This is America you cannot treat your customers like this and get away with it . And it such a shame because in this small indian community of Charlotte one wants to spread the word about their fellow indian business and help them out . But this place is not worth all the undhia in the world . It left a really bad taste in my mouth and we will never step foot in there again . ',\n",

She did explain one item when asked but just seemed to be in a hurry . Our food did come out fast but not all together . One person was done when the last meal come out . I get that most share and we did share some items but the last meal received was for someone that was not sharing . We were given some take away containers before being asked and before being done . . . I guess we were at the table to long ! Ha ! With so many reviews and pictures will keep this short . The potstickers and Soup Dumplings we had were very good . We had the drucken chicken to start and it was a little to cold from sitting in a cold refrig . We were there on a Sunday when they are suppose to have Shrimp w . Loofah Soup Dumplings but it was not available . . . we were there for an early dinner so not sure if it was available that day or not . We had some steamed broccoli with the minced pork sauce that was cooked perfectly and very good . I am a fan of the food but the rush to get you out and the lack of any real service was strange !

       " 'I came by with some friends to give Boteco a try . Certain dishes tasted excellent while others were more pretty looking than good tasting . The dining area is not too big however dining on the outside patio is also an option . our server was nice and checked on us often . Chicken and Mash ($14) - Braised chicken red wine mushrooms pearl onions and bacon with a side of buttered potato puree . This was the one thing on the menu I could not wait to try . It Chef Rachel twist on Coq Au Vin . Seeing this dish arrive at the table it looked presented well and I could not wait to dig in . The potatoes are made with 50 percent butter and tasted so effing delicious ! If you order anything here order the mashed potatoes ! The chicken was served in a dish that had no red wine sauce in it . I as well my friends agreed that this dish was lacking the sauce and was dry with out it . I asked our server for some of the red wine sauce to pour over the chicken and it made such a huge difference ! I did get a free sangria with this meal which was a great deal however it did not taste that great . Strawberry and Champagne Pancakes ($8) - These are dutch baby style pancakes . The price is very fair but the way these tasted left us all needing a drink just to swallow each bite . Too crispy on the outside and still somewhat raw in the center . Salted Caramel Budino ($6) - Caramel toffee vanilla custard and crunchy fleur de sel . Though not as good as the now closed DOCG this one will do just fine . We also got some type of apple strudel (also $6) and we all pretty much enjoyed the desserts more than the actual food . The menu is kinda limited but I feel there room for improvement and would not be against giving Boteco another try in the future . Boteco has wine tastings and you can find any of the upcoming events on their social media pages . ',\n",
       " 'Chino Bandido has undeniably become one of my favorite restaurants . Back in L . A . they are just now discovering fusion food and it roaming around the city in lunchtrucks using Twitter to guide their customers . This brick - and - mortar place has been around for 20 years . On walking in we were greeted with \"Is this your first time? I have got samples for you ! \" with a kind worker behind the counter giving us tastings of several of the meats rice and beans . I got a combo with a jerked chicken quesadilla a pile of the red jade chicken pork fried rice and refried beans and I was not disappointed with any of it . Jerked chicken was REALLY spicy but damn good . Outstanding blend of food . It transported well (took it to - go) and tasted just as good the next day after 2 minutes in the microwave . And it so easy to get into the spirit of the place . While waiting for our order these two guys came in and started taking pictures posing with the autographed poster of Guy Fieri and checking out all of the news clippings on the wall . While they discussed what they might want to try I mentioned that if it their first time they can sample the food . Their eyes lit up and they raced to the counter where another nice worker gave them sample cups of everything . One of them excitedly piped up with \"I will have whatever Guy had . \" Yep definitely a favorite . ',\n",

It was almost like a festive potluck once we brought all the food together on the table .

This (former Dairy Queen?) has so many bars on the windows you may feel like you are in (or have a flashback to when you were in) the mess hall at San Quentin (Sheriff Joe Would stick you in a tent city) . Actually - the interior is very clean the tables and chairs are new the service provided is very nice - plus (bonus) after lunch you are not limited to 30 minutes of rec time per day in the yard . The food is damn good . Small portions for small prices . Order at the counter and then take a seat in the dining area . We tried the picadillo and rajas gorditas as well as the standard beef and chicken tacos . Authentic . Tasty . But not mind - blowing . . . The condiment bar es muy bueno . The chunky salsa verde is the shining star and their runny guacamole sauce is similar to that at El Guero Canelo . But I thought the red sauce tasted too much of the same flavor as a can of El Pato sauce and they slice the fresh radishes waaay too thin (like thinner than potato chip thin) . And what is up with served ice cold charred serranos? If you want 5 stars from me those roasted peppers should be roasted daily and served warm !

       " 'I was starving and sick from a bad sinus infection . . . My cravings were something fried but also wanted some spicy soup to balance the two out . My thoughts were Tang Soo Yook and Jjampong ! ! ! We walked in a few minutes before closing and asked the server if she was still serving . . . she went back to the kitchen to see if the light was still on . If the light is on that means the Chef can still cook for us and luckily it was ! ! ! I enjoyed their Tang Soo Yook which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly - like sauce . . similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over . This came out steamy hot ! ! ! Tasted fresh and love the tempura cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat . The oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp . Each bite was pipin hot and delicious . The sauce that completes this dish consists of sliced cucumber carrot napa cabbage wood ear mushrooms and onion . I would say without this sauce . . it would be very plain jane and definitely would not be as good . Love ! My minus one star was the Jjampong . Although it had chunks of seafood it lacked flavor tremendously . It was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up . The spices did not really do it for me and I felt like there were some missing ingredients that could have done wonders for this soup . That was the only thing that was not so great but I did enjoy the texture of the noodles in this soup very much . Their side dishes is very limited to only daikon and kimchi . But their kimchi is very notable . . . my Father loves the kimchi here and so do I . Small bite size square cut shaped lightly seasoned crisp with a solid homemade taste . If they sold this by the jar I would definitely buy a few :) Delicious . This restaurant is also very known for their Jjajangmyun . A thick black soybean paste sauce with diced meat (pork) and vegetables (mainly diced onion) . Normally if you ask for Jjajangmyun the sauce is already pre - made but you can ask the server to cook the sauce fresh which is called Gan Jjajang myun . If you like your vegetables cooked well then order Jjajangmyun . If you like your vegetables semi - raw then you will enjoy Gan Jjajang myun . I enjoy mine cooked well and so does my Mother . My Father on the other hand orders the semi - raw . I do not think anybody knows that they can order it this way so just sharing how my Family and I order our food choices here . The location is somewhat hidden . . it tucked in a corner nearby 168 market . . in between the Furniture Store and Nelson Barber Shop . Even the name of this restaurant is written in Chinese Characters so do not look for Shan Dong ! ! Good service great meal and satisfies my cravings for Korean - Chinese cuisine . ',\n",

My plus one ordered us some strawberry jalapeno margarita and those were perfectly spicy & sweet . Our server Kayla (who was freaking amazing ! ! ) told us about some locally brewed beers they have on tap and sold me on the Koffee Kolsch which was like a cold brewed coffee smelt delish and tasted great you got the full flavor of caramel and hazelnut this was a great tasting beer ! We had dinner catered by Top Golf it consisted of Pickled Fried Chicken Slow Smoked Beef Brisket Green Chili Mac & Cheese House Baked Beans freshly baked rolls salad & the fixings and bbq sauce pickled onions & slaw and unlimited water sodas teas & coffee . The pickled fried chicken was pretty good chicken the freshly baked buns with the beef brisket topped with pickled onions & slaw drizzled in the bbq was the bomb . com . I had high hopes for the green chili mac & cheese but sadly it was the loser of the night not only did it seem to not have the cheese it was bland no flavor no salt and yes you saw the green chili but even they lacked the flavor . Just say no to the green chili mac & cheese everything else is great ! Now on the golfing we had about 10 bays reserved and after some great help from TopGolf staff we were all set up and ready to play I have to tell you I did not really think this was going to be that fun but boy oh boy was I wrong ! I think I have found my game such a rush hitting the ball and watching it fly and land in one of colored goals ! I was channeling my inner Tiger Woods ! So much fun ! Honestly cannot wait to come back to TopGolf this place is fun for all ages perfect for date nights or just hanging out with friends ! . ',\n",
       " 'I hope to bring awareness to our unfortunate experience at Futo Buta to prevent another disabled persons from having to be treated like we were . We were treated with outright mean spirit and disrespect by our server Abbey who did not understand that a disabled guest could not sit on one of the restaurants high tables or on a barstool . We arrived shortly after opening at 11 am and the hostess graciously sat me and my disabled lunch buddy at one of the tables with chairs and not the tall barstools . The physical limitations of the person I was with inhibit them from being able to sit on a barstool or at a high table . The server much to our surprise started off her introduction by telling us that we would have to move to a tall table if it they got a rush . After pointing out the obvious and explaining to the server that my lunch partner was disabled and could not sit on a barstool (clearly ! ) the server repeated her introductory statement that we will have to move to another table if they got busy . It is not clear why this was such an issue to the server or why she felt we should have to be moved . We were the first customers of the day . At this point there was one additional customer now sitting at the bar . We were not in anyone way and were not blocking anyone or thing . We were taking up the same amount of space that any other two people would . We would be happy to move if it was for a valid reason but the server did not have one . We just wanted to have a nice lunch . We have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect . I suggest the restaurant management ensure they have a good plan to accommodate individuals with disabilities or inform disabled guests of your inability to do so . If you do have plan you should make sure your staff is aware of it . Our sever was clearly were not aware and lacked any kind of sensitivity or understanding to the situation . What a terrible awful experience . ',\n",

Say hello to the SMALLEST and stingiest plate of food I have ever ordered . I am honestly so shocked that they had the audacity to try and charge people for that .

       " 'All I want is for this place to do well . It deserves it . Basically if you survive the terrifyingly steep steps downstairs you will enter what appears to be a speakeasy beneath the Unitarian Center . And by speakeasy I do not mean Prohibition Chicago era hideouts for liquor runners I mean a Vegetarian Speakeasy for hippies - - the best kind of speakeasy . :)The decor is eclectic and homemmade . It basically looks like a co - op and is inhabited by the usual college town cast of characters : hipsters professors crunchy folk punkers and any person who likes great food . I enjoyed my butternut squash bisque soup and was disappointed that they were out of cornbread today - - Keep that in mind and come relatively early to avoid having them run out of foodage . Otherwise you should enjoy . Go and at least check out this awesome local community spot that really seems to care about the area around it . Good call . :)One note they only take cash much like the Y - Thai . But really if you are eating on campus you should spend your money on places like Y - Thai or Red Herring rather than the soulless corporate eateries lining Green Street in CampusTown . And there free wifi . Hot damn . ',\n",
       " 'I have a problem . I sometimes get a really bad craving for hot dogs . Up to now I have been out of luck in Charlotte . I mean there the great Matt Chicago Dogs but it in Uptown and it a hassle to park . So when the craving happened I went to Yelp and it brought me to JJ . Figuring I would start right at the top of the menu I chose the \"Number One\" which comes with hot relish onions mustard and a pickle spear . It was a good choice . Nice amount of toppings and the bun was perfectly toasted . Do not get me wrong I m usually a \"boiled\" wiener rather than a \"roasted\" weiner kind of guy but there just something to be said about that charred flavor ! (Next time I will read Ben review and try peanut butter sriracha and bacon . )I also got a side of onion rings (thank you Yelp check - in offer) . Thin rings of onion coated with batter and fried . Not the thick ones I usually see . These actually tasted of onion . And fried batter . Unless you are planning a coronary you might want to pick something a little healthier . Maybe the slaw?Soda fountain tea urns (I mixed some unsweet into the very sweet tea) and some bottled drinks . And beers . Very small parking lot during the busier lunch hours so you might be stuck parking on the street and walking a bit . But it worth it . ',\n",
       " 'Had lunch with a buddy and he suggested this place which I had heard about but not tried . In short it was great ! Once you figure out that the menu lacks things like pancakes or whoppers you really have a good variety of tasty meals to select from . I had the power grain with grilled chicken added . You also had the choice of adding quinoa or something called 7 grain . I tasted each and preferred the 7 grain as it justed tasted better with the barley wheat pieces and it was a warm item very tasty . My friend had a salad with large fresh chunks of avocado that looked delish . Overall the food was excellent (5 5) . It a simple counter order and they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready . Simple and efficient (5 5) . Give it a whirl you will enjoy it ! ! ',\n",

Go figure . I m a bit of a millionaire (actual percentage varies but it has been known to exceed the single digits) so I decided that I was going to pick up the check on dinner for the three nights we were in town . I made all the reservations and I made sure we were all on time . I am that kind of guy . This is how I have amassed my aforementioned fortune . Details . The deets . We got to Palazzo a few minutes late actually so disregard anything I said about our timeliness . Anyway they seated us right away . We had a nice round table with a view of a support column . It was one hell of a sexy support column mind you . All white and supporty - looking . Damn . I bet it works nights on the other side of town if you know what I mean right right right?OK this review is getting carried away with itself I m sorry about that . Realizing that most of my family were classless heathens from New Hampshire I decided to let the waitress know our food allergies and from there order anything she thought we might like . This might be the time to let you know that if you do this they do a very good job of selecting tasty pain - free food but it may result in somewhat of a shock to your wallet . Just an FYI really . Five people with limited alcohol being served and the bill came to about $450 after tip . A dent in my bank account you see as I am ballin out of control . I want to say something about making it precipitate that has not already been said but I cannot think of something witty enough to include here . Please imagine dollar bills falling from cumulus clouds at a rapid pace . Everyone was happy with the meal though on the way in one of our group suggested that we go to Senor Frogs instead and I almost did a 180 and walked back to my white Audi A5 2 . 0T with tan leather trim and drove all the way back to LA that instant leaving my brother behind even though he was not the one who made the comment . Almost . But I did not because it was mom 60th birthday weekend and I was not going to let them bring me down bro . PS we ended up going to Senor Frogs for drinks after and it was fun too . My brother ordered a drink that almost came out in a glass shaped like male genitalia . These are the moments that Instagram was invented for brother . If I were you I would listen to the following advice from me : go to SUSHISAMBA and remember that money is temporary but food is forever . And then order like a man on the electric chair . YOLO for sure . ',\n",

The waiter explained that the portions were not \"overly large\" he was somewhat correct but he should have said they were absurdly small . I do not often leave a restaurant hungry and thinking where can I stop on the way home for a quick bite . The waiter explained that we should share the meals but order a number of courses which is what we did . We started with a Ceasar Salad it was very good but small in size our second course was an order of Barrata cheese which also was very tasty . Our third course was pasta we ordered a Cavatelli with chicken there was barely two tablespoons of past . Absurd I believe it was $18 and was supposed to be a main course and was barely an appetizer size . Our fourth course was Flank Steak . $35 they first brought out steak knives that you could use to butcher the ox with and then out came the steak . Eight or so thin strips of steak I mean thin it would have been laughable if I was not paying for it . The atmosphere was very nice and all the dishes were very tasty and well done . The place was packed tonight but my guess is that they will be out of business in six months . No Ox got fat eating here . ',\n",

Upon arrival and a quick check of the menu I had pretty much already decided on GA recommendation that I consume the Chicken Fried Steak (CFS) on this day . I did make a cursory glance at the burger menu having seen a burger bar located at front of the establishment . I did not pay it much attention after I spied you could \"load\" your house potatoes and or hash browns . . more on that later . Our initial server was on point though I cannot remember the name her friendliness would eventually begin to slide . Perhaps she was late for her lunch break . Thank you deserve your welcomes . As I recall she did not conclude the breakfast lunch for four transaction . I ordered the CFS . The eggs were over easy . My hash browns were \"loaded . \" Loaded - cheese sour cream and chives . BAM ! This is a welcome addition to a potato prepared in any style . Instead of bread I went with a single flapper jacker . Somewhat tasty but lacking in any sort of warm to melt butter I would eventually have to scrape it off . Might be back . . . might not . . . All in all a solid three star experience . ',\n",

       " 'A delicious update ! I have not been here since they expanded their space and changed up the menu a bit so we decided to try out Crepe Bar for breakfast today . We got here a few minutes after opening (9 AM on Sunday) and there was already a line 5 - 6 people deep to order ! That gave us time to decide what to get at least . There is a good variety of savory and sweet crepes various coffee and tea beverages and a small selection of non crepe items . I had the octopus crepe tried a bit of the tahini chicken crepe and shared the dulce de leche crepe to finish our meal . While we were waiting for our order the server brought out a small plate of chicharron with dipping sauce . It was a great way to pique our appetite and had a lovely presentation . Our entrees looked even more beautiful with a well balanced presentation and mix of colors . My octopus crepe was served on 3 small crepes open faced . Because the crepes were thin and the filling plentiful but crumbly it was hard to get a good bite of filling with crepe . I loved the presentation but I think having a more traditional folded up crepe would make it easier to eat the dish . In general the octopus was tender and flavorful but was slightly chewier than the amazing octopus dish at Virtu and Nico Heirloom Kitchen . The chorizo in the dish was decent but after a while I was wishing there were a slightly sweet element in the dish to balance out all the salty flavors . Perhaps a small squeeze of orange would help brighten up the dish . I tried a bit of the tahini chicken crepe which had a lovely balance of flavors and textures . The chickpeas were a wonderful surprise as they were dehydrated so they tasted crispy and light . Our dulce de leche crepe for dessert was amazing . The fresh slices of creamy banana went well with the soft crepe lightly sweet sauce and crunchy candied pepitas . I would definitely order this again (And again and again) ! I ordered a Moroccan spiced almond milk latte which had a subtle hint of exotic spice with a light flavor of honey . It was a well balanced drink . Note that the hot drinks (At least with my latte) are served in a cup that has no handle . My hands got a bit sticky since some of the coffee and milk spilled off the side and I had to grip the cup with both my hands to drink it (First world problems right?) . Overall it was an enjoyable experience . I will definitely come back again ! Upgrade one star . ',\n",
       " 'This is an interesting place . The inside is open and very utilitarian . There are not a lot of frills . The service is good and the prices are fair too . I enjoyed my meal but I could not eat hear to often without gaining a crazy amount of weight . Everything is tasty but not great for you . I ordered the Mexican Crepe . I can assure you this is not what the French have in mind for crepes . That being said it was good and very filling . The crepe is filled with homemade chorizo onions green chilies and cheddar jack cheese . It is served with their Habla Diablo potatoes and toast . The flavors combined for a very good overall product . The potatoes were pretty good too . This is a great place for breakfast food . Which as we all know is great for any meal . ',\n",
       " 'I do not get it . Not only this place has excellent reviews but the parking lot is packed from 5 am till well past midnight . And I see it every day I m not exaggerating . So finally I dragged my husband in there for lunch . We wanted to see what all they hype was about . And??? we still want to know what the hype is all about . Ok so I get it must be a great bar so I understand it being crowded during typical \"bar hours\" . But what is up with 6 am or 10 am or 12 pm? The service was good I admit . The lady that helped us was very friendly . But the food well it was just average bar food . And the place is dark and cavernous . . . again great for a bar but breakfast or lunch?

       " 'To my Asian friends both Yelp and un - yelp alike before I continue with this review I want to clarify that I do not pretend to be a great aficionado in the Dim Sum category . In fact as I clearly discovered today . . . I cannot even say I know what the heck I am doing without supervision - please make sure I never enter a place like this without a special helmet on and someone holding my hand . I was sooooooo lost today . Like . . . . . sooooo lost ! I have not been for proper Dim Sum in probably 5 - 6 years and the last time I can remember having it I was with a Dim Sum vet who ordered for us and I just sat there happily filling my gullet with tray after tray of steamed dumpling goodness . But darn it I m an adventurous kinda fella so when my good buddy asked me to brunch today I said . . . sheeeettttttt I m a Yelp CM I know what I m talking about . . . \"Let go for Dim Sum YO ! \" . . . . . . . NAY NAY . . . . . I soon realized I know . . . . . NOTHING ! We entered into Regal Palace amidst a literal sea of people waiting for their fix you need to be aggressive here and push to the front to ensure your spot in the queue is secure otherwise you may never get a seat . We had a solid 20 - 25 minute wait for a seat but other patrons took the time to explain the numbered seating process and what number in the queue we were - thanks friend ! Upon being seated we were presented with the menu and for my fellow white brethren do not be confused while viewing their menu . . . each item comes with a S M or L before the writing and each of those letter denote a different price per dishS = $2 . 95M = $4 . 20L = $5 . XX (Ca not remember exact price)Going back to my inexperience I honest could not remember what I liked at Dim Sum I was trying to order from meal descriptions and from memory (and by looking at what those around us were ordering) \"OH that looks good I will have one of those ! \" FAIL . I felt like the kid who could not read in a grade 2 class and I seriously would have benefited from a picture book to order . However after many broken English Q&A with my server (who I have to give so much love to for being patient with me and walking me through the menu) my friend and I pulled together a Dim Sum meal for the White and DUM (aka me) ha ha ha ha . While I cannot remember the names of what we had here is a brief description of the items and my thoughts :1) Pork and Shrimp Dumpling - UNREAL (ordered it twice b c it was so nice) **CAUTION : HOT**2) Pork Dumpling - Loved it3) Deep fried Pork Dumpling - Did not like these as much as they dough was kind of sticky and chewy4) BBQ Pork Bun - Deadly so delicious5) Vegetarian Spring Roll - Nicely cooked6) Sticky rice with pork and some sweet seasoning in it all wrapped in a banana leaf - This was a huge mound on our plate and we cut at it and liked the sweet break7) We also had what I can only describe as long flat wide noodles with folded over 3 times with shrimp on the inside (2 - 3 shrimp) served with Soy sauce on the side - YummyI apologize for my ignorant descriptions in advance folks I m trying ! I seriously need to put my Dim Sum training wheels back on and have others come with me to show me the ropes . All that being said the busy spot bread slightly longer waits between courses but at the end of the meal we were both satisfied and enjoyed our excursion into the Dum Sum World WAA (Without Asian Assistance) . Next time I go Im bringing experienced Dim Summers along for the ride . Ca not wait ! ! 8 30',\n",
       " '15 minute wait for a to - go order for a single burger . The restaurant was empty save 3 people .

It seems the burger was ready and just sitting there in the bag for a while . It would be one thing if it was busy in there but it was dead !

More precisely the $16 pastrami on rye . After arriving to Las Vegas the boys and I were famished . We dropped off our bags in our room that had two . . . . yes . . . two toilets in separate bathrooms . This is important when you are sharing a room with guys that are all experts in the art of synchronized bowel movements . Then herded down to the casino floor . After shoulder bumping all the sloppy drunk girls with runny mascara we made it to the promise land . The pastrami on rye . Not overly salty . Tender . And more importantly a genorous heap of sensual pastrami . Just thinking of it makes me yearn for it . I positioned it in my hands as to where I would not bite off my fingers and devoured it ever so quietly hoping no one would see me . When I looked down upon my empty plate I was left wondering where my pastrami on rye went . Had I lost myself in it entirely and lost all sense of reality that I was left wondering if it was fictional?I left and the thought of what had happened haunted me the whole night while I was splitting 8 and doubling down on 10 and 11 . All the while having the surgically enhanced cocktail waitress bringing me vodka tonics . Only to have myself imagine her cleavage was actually a mound of Canter Pastrami . Hallelujah . ',\n",

       " 'I have been anticipating the opening of Thai Express for quite sometime now . Like many others I was thrilled when I saw that there was going to be a Thai joint opening up on this side of town . I m a huge fan of Thai food and I had high expectations for this place however I was a bit let down after my visit . The menu is very simple . You start by choosing your dish - Soup curry fried rice stir - fry salad Pad Thai etc . Next you choose your protein - Shrimp beef chicken vegetable tofu fish or battered chicken . The price of your dish is based on the protein you choose . You then choose the spiciness level of your dish . If desired you can make your dish a combo with a side and fountain drink . I chose the General Curry as my dish battered chicken in yellow curry served on a massive bed of white rice . The curry was not as I expected . The base was thick and more like a paste or sauce instead of the traditional creamy broth - like base that I am used to . Potatoes were still undercooked and there were too many bell peppers for my liking . There were also pineapples in the mix which was a first for me and interesting at that but it a sweet touch . Overall the dish was just OK . I most likely would not order it again . I enjoyed the Imperial Roll and the dipping sauce it came with . I appreciate the fact that your food is made to order and the portions are quite large . I had a lot of leftovers to take home in the cutest to - go container . The interior of the restaurant is very clean and decorated nicely . I love the pink barstools and the tile floor in the very center of the dining area . Customer service was great . The employees were very friendly ! Given that Thai Express has only been open for about three weeks I m going to give it a while before I return to try other things on the menu . Hoping to add more stars to my updated review in the future after they work out the kinks and get settled ! ',\n",

It has a smallish inside with free wireless a coffee bar and a small but well - appointed menu that is just full of delicious stuff . There a huge outside patio which has some good tree - shade so that it palatable even when it a bit too hot to sit outside under other circumstances . We had some of everything when we went . The panini are served with this thick (in size - - it was not very dense at all) bread that is buttery and flaky and golden all at once and really good ingredients . My mom got the melon and prosciutto panini . I got the veggie panini (tomatoes red peppers artichokes etc) which was really great - - my personal preference would be fewer red peppers but I just plucked them off . There a chimichurri panini . All really good . There a panini (I m guessing the singular of panini is panino but how pretentious should I get in this forum?) with mozzarella and tomato and basil . Yesterday was vegetarian day and there were plenty of options for that . They also offer bruschetta where you choose from a bunch of different options - - mostly the same as would be available on the panini so a lot of the above possibilities - - and that received rave reviews as well . The wine was half off . The cappuccinos were tasty (I hear) . Sam was charming . What more can I say?Ah - - one more thing . They had a flourless chocolate dessert from Tammie Coe which was my first experience with a Tammie Coe item and it was reeeeeally good . It was called the Chocolate Sensational and it had a few berries around the rich chocolate thing . I would add more berries if I were god . But I m not I keep getting told . One final note . There are a couple reviews that bash the place for slow - ish service . I would just remind everyone that this is not ihop - - this place has a south american (and in my opinion european) feel and if I can tell you anything about service in south america it do not be in a hurry . I know you rebut : we live here . in north america . But that is not the point . The point is this : you go to this place to get a taste of what such a restaurant would be in south america . it clean it cute it small . the food is excellent and surprisingly well priced .

       " 'Buffets are overrated and the free breakfast at your mid - budget hotel is just cellophane bagels and hard - boiled eggs . Solution? The Peppermill . It freestanding not buried in some casino so you can park for free and be in the door right away . If there is a wait go hang out in the Fireside Lounge and have a delicious Bloody Mary . It will quiet the demons . Upon entering you will see that the pink purple and aquamarine color scheme is so becoming when combined with the thousands of disco - ball mirrors lining the ceiling . Fuchsia neon gives the place all the warmth of a stretch limo circa your cousin quinceanera in 1986 . The flamingo - patterned Tiffany - esque lampshades are the essence of class as are the velour booths . On every table is a dispenser full of rainbow sugar which matches the decor . If you think all this sounds cheesy I want you to know that the place is in perfect condition and squeaky crazy pristine clean . Yes there is a jungle of silk plants but not a speck of dust anywhere . It is a lovely inviting restaurant . If you have ever been to the Madonna Inn you will know what I am talking about : well - maintained kitsch is like a beautiful rhinestone - bedazzled Nudie suit one is never ashamed of wearing . The breakfast portions are enormous . The fruit plate is more like a party platter for 12 . Two people could split an omelet and leave the table full . The hash browns are crispy not soggy or greasy . These are restorative foods . Combined with the Peppermill professional attentive service you can feel your hangover receding with each bite . I always leave the Peppermill ready for my day events whether sunburning by the pool shopping in the outlets hiding in a dark hotel room watching \"Ladyhawke \" gambling away my retirement savings or braving the gridlock on the 15 .

I would not say this is the best dim sum out there but not bad for a restaurant open 24 hours . What makes this restaurant NOT so PERFECT is their service . It incredibly slow and inattentive . You will most likely have to wait for someone to notice you . As I looked around the tables beside us were also looking for an employee . If you need refills on tea (do not even bother asking for water) extra napkins sauce or anything you may be waiting for a LONG time . What did come out quick was our bill ! Plenty of seating is available . The restaurant is not all that organized . Though the service was bad their food was still good . I would not go out of my way to eat here .

Service was really good coffee was delicious we ordered a couple of plates and shared . My highlight was white mac and cheese with charred radicchio and pecan gremolata with an egg over easy flopped in the middle ! The grits were some of the best grits I have ever had in a restaurant . Super fattening the way grits should be and salted correctly . Count me in ! ! It has such a good vibe the owners are there and it seems like a friendly family work environment it shines through with the service and food . ',\n",

I m allowed into the pool but my 6yr old daughter cant join me? Are you seriously telling me that the Silverton is too packed to allow locals to bring their child? I am very upset about this . Why allow adults to go in and not children? Possibly make it that locals can being their children in during the day and then maybe make a cut off time that kiss arent allow in there . That would make better sense . I thought hotels casions were suppose to cater to the locals since we are the ones to recommend your hotel to people that ask where they should stay? How disappointing ! ',\n",

       " 'If you are a resident of north of Toronto and a fan of kabob you are not without your options . The mini takeout spots seem to be popping up everywhere . They all seem to offer pretty much the same menu . Barg (tenderloin) koobideh (ground meat) and joojeh (chicken) are the staples at these places . The quality of the meat and the way it is prepared varies from place to place . I found the barg at Shater Abbas to be very good . In fact I was so impressed with the tenderness of the meat that I was hardly bothered by some of the flaws I noticed with the food and service . For example the rice served with the kabob was dry and low quality by my guess . The dressing used for the salad was obviously of the cheap store bought variety . The mast - o - musir (yogurt and shallots) dip we ordered did not come with bread and it probably never occurred to the waitress that we would need some . Next time I wander into Shatter Abbas I would like to try the authentic looking dizi (a traditional stew) that was served with ghusht koob and crocks to the table next to us . ',\n",

The bar is at the front and the booths tables are at the back which means between the lack of windows and the dark purple black silver decor we felt like we were in a cave . I was honestly surprised the sun was still out when we left because I thought it should be pitch black . Our waitress was fantastic and checked on us just enough . For dinner I got Grandma Bibimbap ($14) which was . . . fine . The sauce it came with was too hot for me so I did not use any sauce and that probably made it drier than I liked . My friends got the Fire Phoenix roll ($14 which came literally on fire and had to be blown out) and the green curry ($14) and they said both were really good . Strangely enough whenever the air conditioner would kick on an odd smell would fill the restaurant . We all decided it smelled like wet dog and were glad when it shut off . Overall it was fine but I do not know that I would be in a hurry to go back . ',\n",

       " 'Based on the Yelp reviews it had received we all went to visit Karey Kitchen yesterday for lunch . This is the second new Filipino place we have tried in as many weeks . The place is very small but nice and cozy (maybe about the size of Mi Cocina Mi Pais) . We went after traditional lunch - rush hours so it was not too cramped . I m actually glad they opted for a small location . Several of our favorite places have gone out of business lately due to too much overhead so it good they are keeping their expenses low . We had our toddler with us so we opted for the outdoor seating and all was well . We tried a variety of Filipino dishes and everything was great . I had the chicken adobo and kaldereta - - both were excellent as was the garlic rice I had on the side . My wife and niece who are both Filipinas also were impressed with the food - - especially the cassava cake which they raved about . Karey also offers Mexican - Filipino fusion dishes which we did not try this time but I might go for an adobo burrito or something next time and update the review . The service was also outstanding - - super - friendly and fast . My wife ended up having a very nice long conversation with the owners after our lunch . Living in a Fil - Am household we are always looking for new places to stock up on Filipino food . My wife is a restaurant manager (Panda Express) so the last thing she wants to do at home is cook - - and as for me well if it does not involve fire or barbeque sauce its better that we not go there . So we order take - out food frequently . Along with Wholly Grill we now have two new staples . I can tell right now I will be stopping here on my way home from work A LOT ! I m giving Karey five stars based on the fact that the food was good the service was fast and the owners were super - friendly . That goes a long way in my book . ',\n",
       " 'First . . . this place is IMPOSSIBLE to find . Get out your Google maps ! It is nowhere NEAR Bland Street (it mailing address) . It is across the light rail tracks from the Bland Station and the Trolley Powerhouse Museum . OK . Now that you have found it . . . be prepared to get up close and personal with the other diners . This place is pretty small and only has a few tables . You can eat at the bar or at a little counter they have built against the window . Also it is SUPER loud . Do not come here on a first date if you want to get to know each other ! The food :Our group had the tonkotsu ramen and the miso ramen . The miso was more authentic . The tonkotsu was a little too greasy and not salty enough (we lived in Japan for over 11 years and have tasted LOTS of ramen . . . trust me) . If you are not a purist both are probably excellent . Also for my taste the noodles could have been cooked a little bit more but that could be personal preference . The pork belly buns . . . AMAZING ! Also they come 2 to a plate but since we had 3 in our group they were willing to do 1 . 5 orders so we could get 3 buns . That customer service ! Speaking of customer service the food comes out FAST ! We were hungry when we got there so that was a good thing ! One thing that IS authentic is the tiny water glasses - - straight up Japanese style there ! They refill often and leave a bottle nearby so no problem . . . just a funny observation . Looks like they have a soft serve flavor of the day . When we were there it was yuzu mango . SOOOO good . And a nice palate cleanser after all the greasy food (pork belly is NOT low fat) ! By the time we left there was a long line of people waiting to get in so even though they are hard to find they are making a name for themselves . Would I go back? Heck yeah . There are about 10 other things on the menu that I want to try . Will I bring my Japanese husband with me (he was not with us on this visit)? Heck no ! I do not want to hear all his comments about this is not authentic and that is not authentic blah blah blah . This little place will remain MY secret (hope he not reading my Yelp reviews) ! ',\n",

I forgot what the food was called but it was a roast beef dish with rice and beans and really was tasty ! The service from the man I am guessing is the owner was good .

When a co - workers son recommended it I jumped at the opportunity to try a new spot . I always go in with high hopes for the danky - dank - dank . Las Deliciousas is not the prettiest . Inside she has surprisingly ample seating the temperature was borderline oppressive and the humans behind the counter were making everything from scratch and made to order . The aromas were intoxicating . I ordered two gorditas and their aqua fresca of the day (which was cantaloupe) . The wait took awhile as all items were made from scratch . Worth the wait . I was met with those delicious Cali vibes and taste sensations . It a little out of the way but not bad and a great spot to hit up before a night out on the strip . ',\n",

I felt like a little more consideration could have gone into the plates . I do not care for the cheap plastic plates you can buy at your local asian grocery (in fact I think 168 probably has better choices) . The tables are also a little too small for the long plates the sushi comes on . Service is ok . The server was nice to start but she took a very long time to bring our water and an even longer time to bring drinks . She did not check in on us after the food was brought either . For appetizers we chose Seaweed Salad and the Jalapeño Bomb (jalapeño stuffed with spicy tuna and cream cheese) . The salad came with a mix of romaine lettuce which seemed a little weird and filler - ish . The stuffed jalapeño was good for it uniqueness but by no means life changing . Bocho Special Roll (tuna crab cucumber with shrimp tempure crab assorted fish on top) it was basically a glorified California roll . It was way too big to eat in one bite and it did not leave any lasting impressions . Sashimi was fresh with large pieces . We ordered Garlic Tuna Yellowtail and Super White Tuna . We ended up receiving regular tuna instead of garlic which is not the end of the world but a little disappointing . I do not really see how this place can be given 5 stars . It makes me wonder what the other reviewers think is good sushi . . . It really not \"as good as it gets \" when there are so many better restaurants out there . I m happy to see downtown expanding their culinary tastes but Bocho has a long way to go before they are the best . ',\n",

Reluctant to try Pastoli in case this was just an owner renaming I finally stopped in here a few nights ago . For a pizza place Pastoli is shockingly inviting . There is a big comfy couch and tables . My friend and I rolled in at 11 :15 PM on a Saturday night . The help was so nice and our food came out super speedy . We were instantly served cheese fries ($4 . 50) that were pretty standard . We also got an extra large pizza with half tomato and half pineapple . The crust was good and they use a sweet sauce . Toppings were an average amount . While we did not need gluten free or other options Pastoli does cater to those with allergies which is pretty cool . Everyone who worked here was beyond pleasant in their interactions and the pizza was quite good ! On top of that as they close at midnight the staff did not rush us at all . Very impressed ! ',\n",

Not a bad deal . Especially it includes free flow of wines and beers . First : do not go there unless you have a discount coupon . I do not think the buffet is worth over 20$ (unless you drink a lot of alcohol) . The food is OK very standard slightly on the cheap side . Suchi bar? lot of rice nothing fine nor gourmet small selection . Cheese? industrial small selection . Meat? quite oily . American buffet? on the heavy side . crab legs? yes unlimited snow crab legs . Frozen though and not cooked very well (very salty watery) . Dessert buffet seemed great . Too bad I do not eat sweet . I think it a 3 stars food - wise for 20ish $ . OK now why 2 stars? Service . your dirty plates can sit on your tables for 20 minutes . piling up . Our waitress was making a pretty long face and worst of all : she dropped sauce and meat from our plates twice (and a lot not just few drops) while removing them form the table .

       " 'I stopped by here for dinner and was not impressed . At first I was standing in front of the al pastor because the menu above says \"Express Line\" under each description so I naturally stood where it said the express line for the al pastor was . Then an employee came over and told us to order with her at another area . They really need to put up the signs better because it confusing . If I would been here before I would know but being this was my first time I had no idea and just went with what the menu said . The lady who took my order was very nice and the inside appeared clean . I have to say the salsa veggie bar is larger here than at most places with more of a variety . Our food was to - go so we stood near the supposed \"Express Line\" and waited for our order to be up . I thought it was strange that the whole time I was there the al pastor on the spit was not turned on . No spinning meat just meat there on the spit . I also never saw anybody carve any meat off for the tacos I ordered . Al Pastor Taco ($2) - Just meat tortilla and if you would like they will add pineapple at no charge . This was just bad . I only took 2 bites and then could not eat anymore . Some of the al pastor was so badly charred and the parts that were not had zero flavor . They do not even out onions and cilantro on them ! I kinda thought that was crazy to be honest . The menu shows what the tacos look like and they have onions and cilantro on them . If the meat and tortilla were good enough it would not even need anything else but this was not anything tasty and I would bet money the corn tortillas on my tacos came from a grocery store and were not made on site . \"Ranchero Al Pastor Taco\" ($3 . 50) - This taco has al pastor beans sour cream guacamole and cheese . The toppings saved me on this taco . While I only found one glob of melted cheese the beans sour cream and guacamole had good flavor . Those toppings helped me get the taco down thank goodness because that first taco just was not edible . Hubby had asada tacos and I tried a bite and spit it right back out because it was gristle .

       " '#@$ ! # ! $@ That is all . :)No jokes . But holy moly is this place DELICIOUS . Came here last weekend after a friend said he had heard good things and I m still dreaming about the amazing fettucine I ordered . The place itself is super cute and cozy and was bustling with people . We waited about 5 minutes for a table for 3 and during our wait we were offered small samples of hot chocolate which were delicious . Once we were seated we spent some time going through the very extensive menu and had a really hard time deciding . I ordered the C Royal drink (super strong) and hubby had the C Caramel (equally strong) both of which were delicious . The drinks were served on a small platter each with a side of chocolate drizzled fruit which we thought was a nice touch . When it came to order our plates the three of us settled on the C Wow (chocolate dome dessert) the Creppucine (with hazelnut ice cream and Nutella) and a waffle cheesecake combo . First of all service is super fast . Second of all the plates are HUGE . Third of all I have not had a dessert this good in forever and a day (the Creppucine is to die for) . Super flavorful crepes sliced thinly and piled on the plate like fettucine mixed in with pieces of deliciously perfect brownies drizzled with nutella and topped with white chocolate shavings with a generous scoop of hazelnut icecream smack dab in the middle of this beautiful plate . . . . The flavors . . . oh . . the flavors were outstanding . I literally went crossed eyed from pure joy when I took the first bite and was so sad when it was over . Huge calorie bomb for sure but this was worth every single bite . The C Wow did not excite me as much and I found it to be overly sweet but if you are a fan of chocolate and caramel you will probably enjoy it a lot . I cannot write anymore because I m now very distracted with my memories of my amazing dessert . . . . Sorry Yelp ! A + for amazing service a great concept and phenomenal desserts . I will be back !

We were heading over to Christian Audigier club which I was against as I do not even like his shirts and can only imagine what his club is like . The promoter was friends with 3 6 Mafia and the girls were stoked about meeting the short one with gold teeth . We were walking over from Haze and met up with the 3 6 guy on their way out of the club . They invited us to go to another club and all I kept thinking was my feet hurt and I really want to try \"the pizza party\" .

I had it in my head I was going back to eat and no one gets in my way when I m hungry . This guy in all his cocky rapper glory was like where are you going mamma? ! I wanna go where you are going and and what is this party? Um . . . . . I m going back to the Venetian because they have something called the pizza party .

I said sure but it going to be very boring as we are just a group of girls dressed in pjs eating our brains out . You will have more fun with the club and the other two girls want to go with you so it was nice meeting you bye - eeeh . The promoter and I rushed back to the suite to eat eat and eat . I got back and asked \"where the pizza party guys?\" They said it was just too big and we ordered from a regular place . WTF? ! I said fine but I m eating how much I planned to eat and I hope there enough food left for everyone else . They just laughed and said \"oh Grace\" . We received our delivery and there was just enough food for me and the girls . As we were finishing the other two girls came back and asked \"Is there any food left?\" The girls answered um no . . . . Grace nuff said . Why did the girls come back early you ask? Because that rapper guy stuck his head up one of the girl dresses in the middle of the club while she was dancing . They freaked out and left immediately . Lessons learned - 1 . Do not order just enough food when you are with me because it not enough . 2 . Do not choose rappers over food because at least food will not bend over and come up your dress . ',\n",

I used to scarf down Sbarro pizza slices shop regularly at Hot Topic and laugh at the people who were buying \"Big Dog\" t - Shirts . Nowadays I still do all of the above ; at the moment I m wearing a tie - dye Family Guy shirt while sipping some Joe out of my Lamb of God coffee mug . A quarter mile of pure international craziness it like landing at JFK Airport . This has to be the must stop place in Vegas for people visiting from all over the world with Saturdays and Sundays being the busiest . I was here recently to get some new gym shoes and the Nike store was nuts to butts packed full of multi - lingual people all clamoring for those discounted SBs and Air Max joints . Not everything in here is a fake or a bootleg product . There are plenty of legit stores who just need to sell that extra inventory like the aforementioned Nike plus Puma PacSun Adidas Coach Disney Stores Under Amour Converse and my personal favorite The Kitchen Collection . Which is the only store in this place that sells dope ass kitchenware at outlet prices . Why do I know this because I love to cook ! ** Sip Sip ** Mmmm this Lamb of God mug makes the coffee taste so delicious . I am not knocking this place one bit great prices on name brand stuff . Shopping here just requires a lot of patience patience I do not normally have . You really need to psyche yourself up when coming here trust me this is not your daddy stroll through the mall this is pure Outlet Mall warfare and with holidays coming up I advise you to pack a flask just to take the edge off . Keep your eyes on the horizon because your shopping oasis is just beyond Auntie Anne Soft Pretzels . ',\n",
       " 'Yet another restaurant that was highly reviewed by Helen Schwab and ended up a disappointment . On the day we visited I started with the chef featured soup what was described as a tomato bisque . What I was served was an ice cold bowl of what seemed to be a blend of canned tomato paste and canned tomato sauce . I do not normally expect tomato bisque to be served ice box cold but the surprise did not end there - - the \"chef inspiration for the day\" (as the soup is described on the menu) was apparently to dump tomato sauce into a bowl add no spices salt or flavoring of any kind and have it delivered to the table . My wife ordered the seafood risotto which comes with a salad . However she wanted to substitute the beet salad for the house salad . This was apparently too much for our waitress to process . Waitress : \"now you know the risotto comes with a house salad right?\"Wife : \"yes but I would like the beet salad instead\"Waitress : \"but it comes with a house salad . I will have to charge you more\"Wife : \"I assumed that - - I want a beet salad . \"Waitress : \"OK . Now what kind of dressing do you want on your house salad\"Wife (stabbing her own hand with a fork) : \"I do not want two salads I would just like the beet salad . \"That was harder work than we expected at lunch . I had the fennel sausage pasta for my entree - - it was fun to try to find the sausage in the dish . It had to be hiding in there somewhere . . . In retrospect we should have left after they served the soup . I cannot recommend this place . ',\n",
       " 'Served is a real Henderson gem . I have been here twice now and both visits have featured food that was fabulous . Both times I had the Ono Wings with rice because that dish is just delicious . I am not really a wing woman but I just love the seasoning they use maybe soy? I recommend this dish for yourself or to share if you are feeling generous . My second visit was with the boyfriend for breakfast and I had the Longsilog (Filipino) breakfast which was just like eating at my parents house . This dish features longanisa garlic fried rice and fried eggs all of which are regular features in Filipino households or at least they are in ours my aunts and uncles and cousins kitchens . Longanisa is a Filipino sausage that on the sweeter side and is usually eaten with rice . Heck most Filipino food is eaten with rice . Although Served is not a Filipino restaurant per se there is definitely a Filipino influence due to one of the chefs being married to a Filipina : he a smart man . I really loved this breakfast and of course I m probably biased since it just brought back all the warm memories of home and Mom and Lola cooking . The staff here is very welcoming and attentive and the overall experiences I have had here just make me want to return again and again . Next on my list to try are the longanisa tacos the Mac and Cheese of the Day and the Miso Pork Belly Burger . ',\n",

I got pork something and pork something else in a combo plate . It was damn good though . We had tried some samples of things and I wanted the pork sample and then I saw some beef and pineapple thing on the menu that I really wanted . I think I was told \"no\" and that I had to order off the giant board on the side . That did not really make any sense to me since the menu above the food said it was their regular menu . In any event then I said that I wanted the pork thing that was on the menu (because it was the only pork thing on the side menu) assuming it was the thing I had sampled . The girl then repeated the pork thing and then gave me two different kinds of pork things . If this is all confusing to you how do you think I felt standing there . As I said in then end I was quite happy with my food . Very flavorful and the price and quantity were great . I will be back without a doubt . ',\n",

       " 'You know a place is good when 1) the lowest rating it has received is 4 stars and 2) every review about it devolves into a lusty food - porny mish mash of words . I love it . There not much to say here that has not already been said but I agree that this is the best chicken I have ever had and this would be a strong contender for my choice of last meal on earth . So instead of a fulsome review I will offer four basic Romados commandments that must be observed . 1) Thou shalt order the spicy oil and lots of it . First it not that spicy . Second it gets slathered on with a paint brush by the same lady who wields a three foot knife (and you would not want to make her upset now would you) . Third it tastes like it primarily composed of wine . Fourth you will find yourself with twisted fantasies about it . 2) Thou shalt not order the white meat . This one should not even have to be explained - you are not here for health food and dark meat is just plain tastier . If you get an extra piece of chicken back you are in for a real treat . Nom nom nom . 3) Thou are not permitted to drink the beer they sell in the actual establishment . This is one of those wtf? only - in - Montreal moments . If it a nice day buy a Molson Dry and take your delicious lunch to nearby Mont - Royal park . Bonus points if it Sunday and you can watch tam tams or LARPing . 4) Do not be distracted by the fries . They are very good but just empty filler . In my opinion you are better off discarding half of them so that you have room for more dark chicken (and back) meat and possibly a delicious quesada (Portuguese egg tart) to finish everything off . 5) What are thou doing? Go eat Romados right now . ',\n",
       " 'Well this is a new fusion - Brazilian - Sushi . Ca not say I have tried a newer combo but from the little Brazilian treats I had here I would have to say it works . Located in the Palazzo this place has an upscale trendy vibe . Service seating and décor were all impressive . On to the food . . . WHEN YOU GO - reservations are recommended if you plan on stopping by after 6 . The place gets uber crowded in the evenings especially on weekends . Like I said I did not get to try as much of the Brazillian side of the menu as I would like - I will def concentrate more on that next time . I can speak for the Waygu Taquitos . Could be the best single bite of anything I had in Sushi Samba . Delightfully crisp and light they were the best taquitos I have ever had . The sushi held it own but they have a lot of competition in Vegas (see my Yellowtail review) . I was impressed with the Lima (shrimp crab and avo) and the El Topo (salmon jalapeno and mozerella ! ) . Excellent oyster menu as well . The Kumamto were delicious but at $5 ea not the best deal in town . All in all I like Sushi Samba and will definitely be a return guest ! ',\n",

I would like one server for my table for the entirety of my meal . For $9 I was brought a quiche that was flavorless and the size of my iPhone 4 . I m serious the height and everything .

       " 'WHAT TO TRY? ! ?Of course the abalone ! I have not been here for lunch but I heard the dim sum here are decent too . The shark fin soup is also very delicious as it heated up at your table ! Their seafood options are great here too . Depending on the season you can get the Alaskan king crab big lobsters or jumbo live shrimp . All very good ! The abalone usually comes with duck feet so if you are not a fan of duck feet let them know to substitute it with something else . I had the quail too . It was alright . I did not think it was crispy enough and did not have much flavor . Make sure you dip it in the worcheshire sauce and the mixed salts for a better taste . The jumbo shrimp was fresh and very juicy . This is a seasonal seafood so ask if they have it available . There was lots of meat in each of the shrimp . Usually boiled and you will need to dip into their soy sauce in order to enjoy this dish . LAST TIP? ! They only take cash or debit so make sure you come prepared ! I suggest you take a look at the combo dinners to see if anything excites you . Always ask what kind of seasonal seafood they have in store and whether they have any specials going on . ',\n",
       " 'Wow . Wow Freakin Wow . I have never ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you learn your name cater to your every need and give you FABULOUS beautifully prepared food since . . . well NEVER . I must say I did do my research so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish . I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York . She had been to Roy before and is a fellow foodie . We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink . It December so a bit chilly but the HUGE soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka . Warning : We had to ask for more fruit juice ! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there . ) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones . I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine enjoying the late afternoon reading conversing . . . . well if I HAD any rich or classy relatives that is . It was very nice and relaxing . Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did . When we meandered inside for dinner the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table . She was very competent could make recommendations and was pleasant without being clingy . We loved her . She reminded me of Joan Cusack . Sounded just like her ! The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them . We shared the Roy Canoe for Two which had Lobster potstickers Beef Satay shrimp on a stick (not its real name) and Tuna Sushi Rolls . I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex . The Beef satay was basically this ultra - tender beef on a stick lightly flavored and grilled . Fabulous . But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls which absolutely knocked our socks off . I have never ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment . I think our server Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy . She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs - up sign . For whatever reason these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine . I re - live that moment over and over . MMM . But you know the showstopper was STILL yet to come . I could not believe my luck when my Roy Trio was placed in front of me . It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce a piece of Seared Ahi and a piece of salmon . The poor salmon ! It was the best salmon I ever had out but next to those two it was like Cinderella ugly stepsister . Just upstaged by the butterfish which is melt - in - your mouth decadence and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER . Amy got the butterfish . We licked our plates clean . Amy tried my Ahi and declared it like I did the BEST seared Ahi on the planet . For dessert you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle . How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face . Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing . The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like . I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good) It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you have been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield which one is better? They are both amazing but by the time Rick comes along well you are kind of spoiled already . Roy could not have been better - this entire experience was an A + + through and through . The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi - pads is out on the marble bathroom counter like party favors for down under)THUMBS WAY UP ! ! ! ',\n",

He like a mariachi band only it one guy I understand the words and I do not shrink in my seat when he comes by . Keep a fiver in your pocket to give him - the guy will need a second hip soon . The service is great too . I did not like much my minestrone soup . It had like every vegetable in it . I could point out so many it was like a Richard Scarry book . So I asked if I could get the salad (mmm with a slice of salami) instead . \"No problem ! \" Can we get more garlic bread? \"Sure please make room for a shoebox size basket of garlic bread\" . Hey since this wine is endless can I leave my car here? \"Please do . Would you like us to fill it with garlic bread?\"Oooh and that hot chocolatey cappuccino at the end w whipped cream !

Just slapped down open face on a plate by that same grandma or from a prison kitchen - $8 mimosa on a Sunday really? ! - No brunch specials or items of any kind - $5 small iced toddy - that price is ridiculous - Music was barley playing and what was heard was not impressive - We just left and walked by a group of staff and no thank you see you later etc .

       " 'We are locals that had started enjoying Toast (and bragging about it to other locals) on a fairly regular basis . We had enjoyed great meals just about every time we visited . However like other posters it was confusing to have three or four people coming by the table . Also one reviewer referred to the female manager as a bitch . That a bit stronger word than I would have used but I knew immediately who she was talking about . During our last visit many months ago my wife hamburger that was ordered medium rare was delivered with a cold bleeding center . No big deal we flagged down one of the multiple people that had visited our table and asked them to cook it a bit more . We were very reluctant to do this because it had boursin cheese on top and we just did not know how it would come back . It came back medium well with no pink in the center . The aforementioned female manager came by to see how things were and we expressed our disappointment . She explained to us that the cook had recently moved here from New York and . . . he was still learning how to cook for people in North Carolina . Huh? After this comment sank in for a few minutes it got me a bit ticked off . My wife and I have both eaten in New York plenty and they cook meat the same way we have requested it all over the country including North Carolina . The manager also told us that she checked the burger when it was first sent back and that it was cooked the way it was ordered . Well admittedly we asked for medium rare and that is not a long way from rare but we got extra rare . Anyone would have sent that burger back I think . So according to this manager either the cook prepared the burger correctly and we were wrong or we were idiots from North Carolina that did not know how to order our food as far as we could tell . Since that visit we have never returned and we will not go back as long as that woman is there . We have stopped bragging about the place and now instead relate our last experience . Others have shared similar opinions with us . Recently at Christmas in Davidson we were cruising the food vendor tents and saw her manning the Toast tent .

Bottigula offers a full open kitchen dining room a large outdoor patio and decent sized bar and lounge area if you are just looking for a few drinks . We showed up early for our reservations stopped at the bar for a quick drink and light bite before the main meal event . The bar is great and I could have easily eaten dinner here and been happy . We sampled the charred octopus and a few martinis and both were perfect . The octopus was very tender and just a touch chewy . Once we sat down we started with Meatballs and Carbonara Mac n Cheese and shared the Braised Short Rib . I do not have one bad thing to say about any of the food everything came out fast and hot which is great because they were busy on this night . Out of everything we ate I highly recommend the Charred octopus and Braised Short Rib order these and you will walk out a happy camper .

Perhaps more specifics are in order . The fried fish had a cold thick and dried - out texture of cardboard . The greasy burgers were overcooked and had a soggy bun . The chicken is dry lacking in flavor and smothered with oily cheese . The corn chowder is a nasty gelatinous goo . The smoothies are extremely sweet and not as thick as they ought to be . You get the idea . . . Why would I continue to subject myself to such awful food? One of the facilities where I work will order lunch for us from various places if we are working through the lunch hour . I m not completely sure who is responsible for picking the place each time but there must be some kind of kickbacks taking place because I cannot fathom why they seem to keep picking this place over a vastly superior alternative like Tropical Smoothie Cafe . One time when they asked me what I wanted to order I told them that I would pass . However this woman felt really bad and insisted on suggesting something that I would like . I ended up ordering some sort of chicken sandwich which was surprise surprise terrible . The most recent time they ordered from here to avoid hurting anyone feelings I just ordered some random sandwich . I took it with me when I left the facility but dumped it in the nearest trash bin . I felt bad wasting \"food\" and for a moment thought that maybe I should give it to some homeless person . Then again if I had they might think that I was trying to poison them . ',\n",
       " 'This review is for New Years Eve . We came for dinner we had no problem getting in at 7 :30 (we did not have a reservation) and we literally made plans that evening for our night (that another story) . We see the sign advertising $29 all you can drink at the bar starting after 9 :30pm . We decided to give it a shot . Well we pay for our wristband and proceed to the bar area . We see two bartenders working . I get the feeling this is not a good idea and it too late now since we bought our wristband . I wait for nearly 20 minutes for a drink I ask for two since I know it going to take forever to get another drink . He would not give me two . My friend comes back with two drinks in her hand . Now I m irritated on top of annoyed . By 10 pm the place is PACKED . It 3 - 4 deep at the bar and still only 2 bartenders . Now I m no bar manager but something tells me that if you advertise $29 all you can drink on NYE you might want to have more than two bartenders on hand . I ended up getting two drinks the entire night . On my way out I almost slipped in vomit and spilled drinks on the floor . Classy . Will I go back? Probably not . ',\n",
       " 'Veg - friendly bites cool cocktails and gangsta rap make Joe an eccentric memorable outing . The ambiance is casual - yet - classy with either booth or bar seating . It somewhat loud but still great for bringing a group of four and chatting it up . I really enjoyed the frites which came with an assortment of delicious sauces the chefs are proud of . I hate ketchup but the *curried* ketchup was outstanding ! And while we are on the topic of curry there always the curried cauliflower app . Bring your herbivore friends to Joe to start off your night and I do not think they can complain too much . Of course there are more rich options as well . Lots of twists on steak and plenty of items featuring chimichurri . . . it like a western European take on Argentinian entrees . The signature item is a \"B . I . G . \" burger yet another throwback to the 90s rap motif . As cool as this is I m more excited for the drinks . When you are not getting a 40 oz . (YES this is totally a thing you can order here) you can indulge in a modest but delightful craft beer menu . On top of that are the *cocktails* . Designed by the mastermind behind my five - star review of Last Drop at the Hermosa (Travis Nass) these beverages are aiming to pack a tasty punch - - at a single - digit price . And while not everything blew me away I will say the Gin and Juice is choice . An absolute must . For the weaker among you try the Sunnyslope Ice Tea . And like the rest of the service these will fly out so fast as to appear effortless all courtesy of a kind and fun staff . Now that retro themes are at the cusp of syncing with my childhood memories I m starting to feel old . I cannot tell you *that* much about the early - mid 90s only that they were seemingly awesome harmonious and certainly much more fun than the late 2010s are shaping up to be . So whether you want to relive some memories or just have a blast with a style that is not yet too big Joe is a solid spot for food drinks and fun . ',\n",
       " 'Of the non - chain Mexican food places in my area this is the closest to where I live but it took me a few years to finally try it out . That because it does not have the flashy signs and banners that the other places have and because the small somewhat run - down building fades into the background of the countless business and food establishments in the area . But while it serves standard small Mexican food joint fare the food here is good ; not exactly fast food as it took a while for me to get what I ordered but the quality is a tad above that of the ubiquitous Berto - type restaurants of the Valley .

So we had no choice but to eat at Wolfgang Puck . . honestly i am not a big fan of wolfgang puck but it beats the food court . . As i entered in the restaurant with a complete attitude of \" I hate wolfgang puck\" my mood started to change . . . . The waiters and staff greeted you welcoming you into wolfgang puck . . I was slowly start to brush off the i ahte wolfgang puck attitude . . . As we sat down water and beverage was taken immediately . . i said to myself hmmmm . . . ineteresting . . love how fast they work . . . The server was really friendly and informative . . gave us the specials and had a positive attitude really good guest service skills pretty impressed . . I was pretty impressed how often they refilled our water and bread basket without being told . . So the food finally came and i was in shock . I was supirsed how huge the portions were . . I ordered the burger and my freind had the pizza i must say DAYUM ! Wolfgang ! i am impressed . . loved the juicey burger and loved the fries . . PIzza was awesome also ! For dessert we had the Banana siffoule it was mmm mmmm good ! Overall Wolfgang shocked the crap outta me . .

       " 'Since the closing of LaVecchia Seafood Grille my thirst for upscale seafood in the Queen City has gone largely unquenched . That is until now when I had the chance to go to Upstream this past Thursday evening for dinner with my dad . Food : In case it has not dawned on you yet this is mostly a seafood spot . Therefore you should probably at least have a taste for good fresh seafood before dining at Upstream . To begin with we ordered a trio of appetizers - the Sweet and Sour Calamari Lump Crab Cakes and the Black Iron Mussel Pot . All of the appetizers were different than similar renditions I have had of these popular seafood dishes . The calamari was not your traditional fried and breaded calamari . Instead the calamari was pan seared not breaded at all and served tossed in a thick sweet and sour sauce - very tasty ! I loved the MUSSELS ! The tomato - garlic sauce the mussels are served in suited me perfectly . The crab cakes were probably my least favorite of the apps - they were good just not great . We split the salmon for our main course . The salmon was in a word flawless . It was super tender succulent and bursting with flavor ! The pearl pasta and scallops it was served on top of was the perfect compliment . Ambiance : As we were able to be seated right away we really did not have a chance to tour the restaurant that much . But from what we were exposed to I certainly have no complaints . Quiet classy upscale friendly chic are all adjectives that come to mind when I think of the ambiance at Upstream . Service : Let me just say our server Brooke was super friendly and was one of the most professional knowledgeable servers I have ever encountered . She was knew the menu from front to back . She was willing to accommodate any request we might have . The only thing that topped the delicious food was the unforgettable service . I think my seafood crusade can finally come to a rest - I have finally found in Upstream what I have been so desperate for over all these years - great service upscale ambiance and fresh quality seafood .

       " 'First visit today and I was not impressed by the food . Service was very good though - - look for Shea and at least for this morning he was at the bar counter . I came in and was surprised by the number of people waiting outside (it was very chilly ! ) and even more amazed to see the line of people waiting to be seated inside . And then it hit me it a Saturday - - I m usually at work at this time . A Yelp friend even warned me last night about the long wait times on the weekends but I was dining solo so I figured I could wait for a spot to open at the bar . I ended up waiting for four minutes - - not too shabby ! Found out that the chocolate syrup in the cafe mocha is Hershey (corn syrup) so I opted for a cappuccino . http : www . yelp . com biz_photos eggstasy - scottsdale?start = 100&select = LQ43uEfOvZzDUBGcY_q4hA#LQ43uEfOvZzDUBGcY_q4hA LavAzza is the coffee sold here and I like LavAzza so far so good . Shea was nice enough to provide me with some receipt paper so that I may jot down a few of the entrees I had questions about and he gave me his suggestions from the list of items I wanted to try and I ended up ordering the Lemon - blueberry French toast http : www . yelp . com biz_photos eggstasy - scottsdale?start = 100&select = CXV8FUkYF - yixQdKW1BIIA#CXV8FUkYF - yixQdKW1BIIA and Fried truffle egg toast . http : www . yelp . com biz_photos eggstasy - scottsdale?start = 100&select = J1on - 3kAP9IHxQNws194sQ#J1on - 3kAP9IHxQNws194sQ As I mentioned I was not impressed with the food . First of all the presentation of both items was not pleasing . There a reason I posted so many of the Fried truffle egg toast and that because no matter how many times I spun that plate around I could not get a decent shot ! Also the plates were not staged in the best way but then again perhaps there was no way to make them appear any better . . . The pancakes were sweet on their own but I added the last bit of pure maple syrup that the kitchen could spare and it tasted a bit too sweet after . They usually come with blueberry compote so I m assuming it was omitted due to my corn (starch) allergy . This dish needed a cream sauce to add another layer of texture . Otherwise it felt like moistened and heavy pound cake to me . The Fried truffle egg toast needed more salt but I was hesitant in adding any more so I added Tabasco sauce instead . The two eggs were sunny - side up and gave the brioche a nice color as well as good mouth - feel with the combo of fried bread egg whites and melted gruyere . This dish needed something else though besides seasoning . Some Canadian ham perhaps? Or a few slices of extra - thick bacon or two or more cheeses? Yes this dish as well as the pancakes had the makings of something great and today offerings do not make me want to order them again . Two lackluster entrees at the same sitting normally would not make me want to visit again so why am I eager to go back? Because of the cool service Shea gave me of course ! First he never made me feel like I was an imposition asking so many questions and sending him to the kitchen with a list of concerns (better than asking him to memorize the questionable ingredients and the four entrees I had my eyes on) . Second when I asked him what kind of chocolate enrobed the bacon I spotted on a neighbor Bloody Mary http : www . yelp . com biz_photos eggstasy - scottsdale?start = 100&select = iiKKb5DG5ApDBjBUEq3 - pQ#iiKKb5DG5ApDBjBUEq3 - pQ he guessed Hershey syrup as well (I guessed Valrhona or something similar) but offered to double - check with the kitchen and came back with an apology that it was not Hershey (I kinda knew) but a Belgian chocolate . But wait here the kicker . . . he excused himself while he grabbed a saucer and napkin and reached into the mini - fridge for a slice of chocolate - covered bacon for me to try (shh ! do not tell anyone) ! What service ! Now I have not had a chance to taste the said bacon slice but I plan to ask for Shea section - hopefully it will be at the bar where the wait time is shorter - whenever I stop by ! Oh and third Shea offered to give me a cup of coffee to - go which is probably a standard service here but still a nice touch ! p . s . The cappuccino was very good ! ',\n",

Very extensive menu with a lot of creative takes on a grilled cheese . It was a very cool laid back décor . I came at lunch alone so sat at the bar . The server was really friendly and kept my Diet Coke full . My sandwich was a basic with American cheese and bacon . It was awesome ! Fries were really good and the honey mustard on the side was phenomenal . I ended up dipping my sandwich in it . I would come here more often if they expanded . ',\n",

Who would have thought that a Toronto based joint could house such a fantastic lobster shack . I was pleasantly surprised . I m already a fan of the Ossington Dundas hood so having another great restaurant there does not hurt . Immediately walking through the doors I felt comfortable . The seafood bar staring right in front of me as spectacular anything could be . It was gorgeous full of snow crab legs oysters and other crustaceans shellfish marine living deliciousness . While seated I enjoyed the relaxing and casual atmosphere . Dim lighting full tables comfortable seats . The menu was simple . Not intimidating divided into 3 main sections : raw bar dishes and drinks . I ordered the lobster poutine signature lobster roll and surf and turf steak tartare . I regret passing up their rock lobster Caesar - it has a Nova Scotia lobster tail in it ! Next time . . . The food came out reasonable quick and I gotta say everything was amazing . The poutine was the best poutine I ever had . Perfect fries great gravy and squeaky cheese all under a mound of lobster . The lobster roll was equally good not too saucy mayo - ey lobster was present and flavors were not muted bun was soft and toasty . Surf and turf tartare was my first foray into tartare and it was tasty . Mustard dressing beef and chunks of lobster all went well on the complimenting potato chips . This dinner was the highlight of my night . It made me so happy . I did not know what expect from Rock Lobster Food co . I thought it was going to be expensive and not filling . However on the contrary it was reasonably priced and satisfied my appetite . I loved it . I had no complaints . Great food good people and fun atmosphere - what else do you want from a seafood shack?',\n",

Service was slow not in a bad way but in a \"this is a nice French cafe so sit there and savour your experience\" kind of way .

I m extremely picky when it comes to sushi and this place definitely deserves 5 stars . The service is always impeccable and it is super clean in here . It does not have the fishy smell that most bad sushi restaurants have . The pricing is very reasonable for the location (inside the Palazzo and on the strip) . The decor of the restaurant is pretty in - tune with the rest of the hotel and other restaurants - hip modern and a little funky . They have great cocktail selection and a full bar as well as a happy hour menu . SERVICE : 5 Stars . I have never had a single complaint about the service here . Every time we come here the service is always consistent and excellent . We celebrated my friend 21st birthday here with a group of about 20 . After ordering countless rolls plates of sashimi cocktails and shots our server graciously brought the birthday princess the 3 Wise Men shots . Doing stuff like this makes you come back because a year later my friends and I still recant this story and bring up Sushi Samba . FOOD DRINK : 5 Stars . Everything is so fresh and good . I usually order Omakase and my favorites seem to be the Yellowtail Uni Fresh Ono and Tuna . The Tuna Tutaki appetizer is excellent and something I order whenever I come here . For non - sushi eaters they have plenty of choices . They have a lot of unique cocktails custom to this restaurant that pair well with almost anything on the menu .

       " 'I m sorry to have to do this but the owner of this place is a jerk . I got yelled at for playing pinball in a way that has helped me play very well in pinball tournaments and leagues over the years and not one time has anyone including the owners of some very rare and valuable games mentioned anything to me about abusing a machine . But that was not the case here at the Pinball Hall of Fame . Instead I was told (in a very confrontational way) that new Stern machines were all made of plastic the flipper buttons (of course) the sides (huh?) and the legs (did he really just say that? ! ?) and that I better calm down or I would be asked to leave . BULL$HIT . He treated me like a moron - - flat out lied to me thinking I must not know any better . This was after he stood about 5 feet away from me with his arms crossed watching very disapprovingly as I would hit the side of an Avatar machine to keep the ball from exiting the right orbit and dropping into the right sling . Watch just about any pinball video or tutorial and it pretty clear this is the sorta thing you have to do to control the ball and continue playing . It also does absolutely nothing to harm the game and hitting the side with a sledgehammer certainly would not have caused a pop bumper to be non - functional or the one - way gate at the top of the left orbit to be jammed up as they were on this particular machine . It also would not have caused AC DC to be about 5 degrees off level . And to make matters worse I never encountered a tilt warning on AC DC Avatar or the one EM I played before I was warned for a second time for making a very light slap save . I would think that Mr . Tim Arnold of such long standing participation in the world of pinball operation maintenance and collecting would know how to set a tilt bob to prevent players from being able to move the game in the slightest since that apparently what he wants . I can now only assume that much too difficult a task and it does not give him an opportunity to eject people that obviously know what the hell they are doing on a pinball machine and that might otherwise complain about the poor operational condition of most of the games in his establishment . I chose to leave on my own after the second warning during which time I was followed out the door while continuing to be berated . I have no desire to ever go back and give this guy another quarter so he can flip it all to the Salvation Army (400k last year) while continuing to let his games sit broken and refusing help from volunteers to get them repaired in a reasonable time frame . You would think he could take some of that money and invest it back into the place but I guess that now how he wants to do business . It keeps the \"complainers\" away . ',\n",
       " 'Like Pig Butts and Cannot Lie??? That BBQ Joint is here to satisfy . Everyone has their own idea of comfort food . For many comfort food is what you grew up eating . . . home - cooked Italian dinners summer barbecues copious amounts of ice cream . . . you name it . An individual version of comfort food largely defines their character . It is representative of their innermost passions and paints a picture of their upbringing . For me comfort food is the food that makes me happy the food that brings me back home . And while I by no means grew up in the south . . . my personal form of comfort food has always been barbecue . When I am feeling down or just plain hungry it is hearty slabs of ribs and slow cooked juicy brisket that I crave . You can therefore imagine the immense joy I experienced when I came across an inconspicuous barbecue spot while strolling down Willy Street . That BBQ Joint had saved the day . Housed within the brick walls of this corner shop is a glorious medley of all things meat . They of course have the classics expected of a barbecue spot serving up sliced brisket pulled pork and smoked chicken . But for the real TBJ experience you absolutely must order the smoked wings and a full slab of ribs . Oh heavens DO NOT FORGET THE RIBS . The quality of the meat combined with the perfect layer of seasoning and a wonderful smoky bite earn these guys high marks . What makes That BBQ Joint a truly beautiful place is the fact that they do not need to drown their meats in an excessive amount of barbecue sauce . Barbecuing is often a contentious topic and like the folks at That BBQ Joint I can affirm myself a staunch supporter of the dry rub method . True barbecued meat should be able to hold its own and not be completely coated in a sugary mess of sauce . I applaud all barbecue places that allow the meat to speak for itself and depend on dry rubs more so than sauces . Thank heavens that BBQ Joint does just this . While some of their items do have a bit of sauce added most everything is served dry . In this way the flavor of the meat is dependent upon the quality of spices and cooking technique instead of the sweetness of the sauce . With this form of barbecue there is more of an emphasis on \"barbecuing\" rather than \"grilling \" with the latter corresponding to a greater use of sauces . It is this barbecuing method that stresses that the meat be cooked at a low temperature for a longer period of time . The resulting product therefore attains an incredible smoke and a moist bite that is simply unattainable via the grilling method . In the words of the pit masters : low and slow baby . So if you find yourself seeking a respite from the humdrum of ordinary food bask in the level of delicious that can be found with some TBJ comfort food . Meat - tastic perfection . ',\n",
       " 'Someone described this coffee shop as groovy . It is an apt adjective to use to describe this coffee shop . Service was fast and both baristas were very efficient . In the space they work in they are able to make all the coffee drinks as well as toasted sandwiches . The wall art is interesting and quite varied . For the Halloween season there are couple of paintings of skeletons working hard . I am sure there is a political message hidden in them somewhere . I had a triple espresso con panna ($3 . 50) in a ceramic cup . It packed a very smooth punch and was good to the last drop . If you enjoy a straight espresso a con panna adds a little sweetness and does not overshadow the flavor . Their drink sizes are interesting - - short tall serious or extremely serious . If you want a sandwich grab a menu and mark what you want on it . Easy as pie ! This is definitely a great local alternative to Starbucks . ',\n",

It is pricey but you get what you pay for and that is a beautiful and large suite with many amenities along with a fantastic pool area pool bar and Riva by Wolfgang Puck feeding you at the pool . The Palazzo is connected to the hotel as well . There are many restaurants to dine at including the ones at the Grand Canale Shoppes . I usually head to the Forum shops when at Vegas but did not want to leave this property this time around . When you check - in and feel like splurging the front desk agent will try to up sell you to a bigger suite - I say go for it . It is cheaper then reserving it online . ',\n",

We found a lovely woman (wish we asked for her name) in the restaurant who had indicated that they were closed for the night to replace the flooring but would resume regular dinner service the following day . She said she would make our reservation for tomorrow evening and make sure we \"will be taken care of\" . We arrived the next evening and it made up for the mix - up before . There is a certain standard at Wolfgang and that was apparent during our service . Our server was very courteous and attentive . there are servers going around tables specially to refill waters and drinks . The complimentary bread basket contained roasted garlic focaccia and whole grain bread . We started with Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers ($17) Creamy Slaw House Steak Sauce cooked medium . The sauce was a combination of tangy (think A1) and sweet BBQ . The steak were cooked into perfect bite size morsels and just melted in the mouth . We ordered the Jidori Half Chicken Braised Kale Yukon Potato Puree Rosemary Jus ($28) and \"Spaghetti & Meatballs\" Spicy Tomatoes Garlic Sweet Basil Pecorino Romano ($24) . I was expecting the chicken entree to be a broasted chicken instead it was a pan fried chicken at of the potatoes that were so fluffy you would think they were whipped . The meatballs were the best meatballs I have ever had ! It was a blend of beef and pork with a little bit of panko bread crumbs . The portions are so satisfying we needed a to go box after eating what we thought was a huge portion of our meal . For our troubles we were comped the appetizers . Our total if we had paid full price would have been $74 before tip . We came here last year as well and the consistency in the food and service has not changed . We are likely to make this an annual stop it so good ! ',\n",

Do not know why I assumed delivery would be free - perhaps it because most places either quote a delivery charge upfront or offer it free with a minimum purchase . In any case delivery was an additional $1 . 50 - whew ! I do not know . . . something about seeing additional charges when I was not expecting any especially AFTER I have already paid and tipped . . . Well it just was a little surprising . It would be nice to know about these extra charges somewhere on the takeout delivery menu yes? I ordered beef lo mein BBQ spare ribs and Hot and crispy beef - all very delicious ! http : www . yelp . com biz_user_photos sYDc1TENwCKLHvprBa5rLw The noodles were prepared well not greasy and the pieces of beef were lean and not sinewy at all ; the ribs had a pleasing chew and were tasty yet not overly - seasoned nor sloppy sticky with sauce ; and the hot and crispy beef delivered on the crispy (yes ! ) without being greasy had slight salty and sweet flavors to it and the chili oil indeed added a spicy kick even though the meat was flavorful without it . (Enjoyed the steamed yet crispy broccoli that accompanied this entree ! ) Thank goodness the lo mein paired well with all the meats since I am not able to eat rice without risking allergic reactions .

While ambiance and decor lend to add stylishness and class to the establishment the service is primarily mediocre . Space is a bit concerning but if you do not mind spartan seating in a dim - lit corner then it poses no issues . It is the space issue that proved rather burdensome (having to get up a few times to accommodate servers passing through can be a bit undesirable - but it was busy and the staff did ultimately accommodate us) .

My wife and I actually played a game where we would see how many waiters or waitresses would either pass by or look at us directly . After about 10 minutes of just sitting there I told my wife if one more waiter walks by us we would leave . My wife was extremely embarrassed at this but I had to put my foot down . Shortly after two waiters walked right past us as they talked to each other . We got up to walk out . As we walked out of the restaurant we both laughed . Not only did nobody notice we were leaving but the greeter who had just seated us actually said thank you have a nice day . I know that this restaurant is fairly new so I wo not talk about the food or drink . Oh yeah we never got to that point . Not sure if we would ever go back to this place .

I L(heart)VERMONT) . There are stickers from popular music artists ranging from The Beatles to The Dave Matthews Band . It quite a sight to behold . Now even though this place is relatively small the staff treat it like it a large restaurant . They take your order seat you check on you throughout your meal the works . Dave has done a great job of selecting a staff who actually care about people . Like I said . . . a sandwich is typically just a sandwich .

       " 'Beso Off is the best way to put it . A restaurant that needs to be shuttered - and in a city where there are many other choices most likely will not continue to survive as the place does not seem to really care about the issues with the restaurant . And cheap food - as in quality not price . Or the head chef is just way too enamored with salt which is usually used to hide the cheap flavoring of sub - par steaks especially the way that they slather it on everything . So this is a cluster beyond clusters . We came here for a business dinner because the Los Angeles location has good reviews . Big mistake . The wait etc was not bad . We made a reservations they sat us when we had more than 50 percent of our party there . The wait staff - Craig and Angie - were super nice very charming and had more common sense than the assistant manager on duty Chad Jahn . Yep totally using the full name . So let start with the cluster :A) Fire in the kitchen (grease fire) that made the whole place smoky . The grill is right there so you can \"see\" them cooking steaks . Big whoop sorta cool but OBVIOUSLY too small for a restaurant of the size . And apparently the back kitchen is just as bad . B) Our salads soups come out fine - nothing spectacular but not terrible - and then we wait for the steaks . And wait . And wait . Oh by the way it only 8 . 30 when we sit down but they are already out of the bone - in filet which the waiter talked up . How do you run out of a steak by 8 . 30 PM? Kitchen incompetence??C) We are still waiting for our steaks . It a good 45 minutes post - finishing our salads and appetizers . We are still waiting . And still waiting . D) Angie and Craig are proactive and good wait staff ; they come up to us and apologize about the wait . It not their fault - the kitchen is run by incompetents but they do their job and do it well . E) The steaks come out . . . medium rare . Not the medium that was ordered but the medium rare . We send them back and one comes back . . . charred on the outside but still rare medium rare . He too nice to send it back and the issue is that the kitchen is backed up so just sending out steaks . Good way to settle a problem with an incompetent kitchen staff : send out undercooked meat and hope they do not send it back to cause more setback in the kitchen . Idiots . F) I ask for the manager - the man with no freakin sense to come to our table . This would be Chad Jahn who looks like a former bouncer that has been elevated to restaurant manger . Demote him back to bouncer that what he seems he would be good at . We talk to him tell him the issues . . . and he never checks up on us again . Good management skills asshat ! ! Oh and he does not acknowledge our issues when we leave . He did take care of the bill but I think he had to be told to do that (I told him we are getting free desserts) . G) I got churros . I like churros . The churros at Costco are better than Beso . Um useless kitchen staff churros are served hot . H) So while walking outside with the colleague for her to smoke we pass by former colleagues and they ask how it went . We told them it sucked to leave . There was this long - haired guy listening to us . I would noticed him for a bit walking around so I said \"are you one of the owners\" and he said no he just waiting for a friend . Um found out he is one of the owners . If as an owner you cannot take responsibility for your poor service and food the restaurant as a whole are doomed . Nice sidestepping and not taking ownership long - haired 80 rocker looking dude ! ! His (or Chad ) solution to the fire and the wait was to offer free Sangria . Thanks and those that do not drink thank you also . Idiots . I) Like I noted the food was salty . The steaks had a salt layer that should not be necessary if they are really Harris Ranch . The string beans mushrooms and other vegetables were slathered with salt as well . Salt is a lazy additive for poor quality and tasting food . Draw your own conclusions here . We got out of there 3 1 2 hours later when it should have been 1 1 2 hour dinner . It not because we were socializing but because it was just waiting and waiting and waiting and then sending back food and waiting . The place is a train wreck rapped up in hipster clothing (well like most things hipster) and the management (and owner) seem unable to manage or take ownership of the problems and issues . Good riddance for when it shuts down (the chef should not be a head chef) but our wait staff rocked and should be at a better place . Eva Longoria Parker should be ashamed her name is associated with this place . But it might not be that long before others force it out . I heard Mastro is opening in Vegas . . . Update : Yay !

       " 'Came here a while back and later gushed to my friend how 800 Degrees has better and fresher ingredients compared to Pieology and it also cheaper than Project Pie ! So I convinced her to come along with me and give it a try . They have the same concept which is basically a Chipotle for pizza . You pick your crust (crispy Neapolitan or gluten - free) your base (margherita bianca marinara or verde) and then add your toppings ! Food - wise we both got what we expected . I ordered a gluten - free crust Bianca with roasted tomatoes pineapples and chicken while she got an original Neapolitan crust with margherita meatball and corn . Quality of our toppings was great ! I love love loved the roasted tomatoes while she loved the roasted corn . Our crust turned out just right we were slightly worried that it would be covered in charcoal as experienced at other places but we were pleased to see it baked to perfection . What surprised me about my visit was the service . I understand that people do not typically order the gluten - free crust but I guess I should apologize to the servers for the inconvenience I brought upon them by asking for it . The first server I was talking to asked if it was just a preference or if it was for an allergic reason . Would there have been a difference if I was allergic rather than it just being my preferred type of crust? Would they have acted more urgently? But that did not leave a negative impression on me until what had happened after . I stood off to the side of the line since I was waiting for my crust as the server was fetching it from the back kitchen for a couple seconds . However I was approached by another server who told me that since I did not have my pizza I should stand farther away because I m blocking the other customers (that had no problem moving right along the line) . I had already stood off to the side and here he was asking me to stand behind the line where I basically lost my place . The original server came back and tried looking for me and obviously could not find me since I was directed by the second server to wait basically out of the line . After all the confusion I found my way back to the first server and who assisted me with my pizza . Why did it have to be so complicated? ! Oh well ! ',\n",

The main problem with Ninja is not its sushi its people expectation of the sushi .

The price food ratio is amazing the service is good and the food itself is very decent . I was not fond of the volcano rolls but my friends swear by it . The classic philly salmon and spicy tuna rolls were prepared well and some of their more inventive rolls (like the spicy New Mexico) were interesting and worth trying . My favorite part about all - you - can - eat at Ninja is when the server starts coming around to see if we want to order more . . . smiling hard because she can obviously see in our faces the look of defeat and gluttony .

And of course what RC is known for top of the line Alberta Grade A beef I mean this is a steak house .

Walking in they have candy and lollipops for sale but they have price tags on them that are way overpriced . I could not ever see spending what they are charging for a sucker that spins . Our server Manolo was great . He checked on us often and seemed genuine not pushy trying to get us to order apps drinks merchandise etc . He just was the type of server you wish you always had when eating out . The place was packed inside and even the tables outside the restaurant were filled but the servers did a great job at taking care of everybody . I ordered a \"S mores Martini\" priced at $14 and was a bit disappointed . Sure it looked cute and tasted alright but it tasted more like candy than anything I would catch a buzz off . My hubby Reese drink was much more tasty . Priced also at $14 I had a \"Garbage Bowl Salad\" for dinner and substituted the vinaigrette that comes on it for ranch dressing . The salad had lettuce pepperoni salami cucumbers tomato avocado mozzarella and provolone . The menu said it also came with croutons but what a bummer they were not on the salad ! There was enough other stuff so it worked out . The salad was really good . I liked the crisp fresh lettuce and the amount of ripe delicious avocados they put in it . The bottom was filled with salami and pepperoni as well . I kept eating and eating and still there was salad left ! The key with Sugar Factory is to come here when it HH or with some type of deal coupon . The drinks and much of the menu is just way too overpriced and coming here and paying full price will more than likely leave not only a dent in your wallet but will probably leave you feeling like not ever coming back . Currently there is a yelp check - in offer for $15 that gets you $25 (not valid Fridays & Saturdays) and they have a groupon right now for this location where you can pick from a few different deals depending on the size of your party . Sugar Factory also has different deals depending on the day . The HH runs Mon - Fri from 3 pm - 6 pm where you can get BOGO cocktails and half off appetizers pizzas and burgers . If you are coming here to drink anyway then coming here when it better priced makes more sense . P . S . The cel reception in here is no good !

Maybe this location presumes too much of it allegedly captive audience . Maybe the salarymens salad expectations are low . In any case a single visit renders this Freshii outpost a one - and - done proposition and makes me leery of ever visiting this chain again . When Freshii first opened (as \"Lettuce\") they offered huge salads with bright crispy veg fun dressings and ample amounts of protein and toppings of dubious nutritional value . Over time portions have declined and the bright young things that manned the counter have been replaced by the same fast food lifers who bungle my order at just about every Tim Hortons or McDonalds or Pizza Pizza in town . Most galling in an effort to squeeze profit like so much wheatgrass juice they eliminated the protein from their salads wraps burritos . A Cobb or \"Buffalo Chicken\" salad now costs about $6 but without chicken . Let allow that the process . . . a buffalo chicken anything for which the chicken costs extra . I have not placed my order yet and my blood pressure has started to rise . Ordering is disorganized ; prospective diners mill about until a brave soul ventures forth to request food . Repeatedly . Including the following exchange :CUSTOMER : \"I would like that with chicken please\"STAFF : \"Tuna?\"CUSTOMER : \"No chicken\"STAFF : \"Shrimp?\"CUSTOMER : \"Chicken\"STAFF : \"Shrimp?\"CUSTOMER : \"Chicken\"STAFF : \"SHRIMP ! \"Perhaps staff are trained in the Seth McFarlane tradition of beating a joke into the ground?Food arrives when it arrives . In this case a noodle bowl and a \"wrap\" . The \"wrap\" arrives without protein meaning it mostly wilted greens drowning in sweet dressing vomiting forth from a stale disintegrating tortilla . Adding insult to injury it not so much a \"wrap\" as a \"clumsy half - ass fold\" which falls apart nearly instantly transforming to its most entropic state . . . \"salad\" or maybe just \"mess\" . The bowl benefits from having a bottom and sides to keep the mediocrity in place . At the bottom of the bowl are a few squares of unadulterated unseasoned tofu and peanut sauce that more Skippy than Siam . Plopped on top are a handful of gummy heated unseasoned rice noodles and on top of that a riot of veg which would be great but for the fact that it all freezer - cold and similarly naked . It all edible but that as far as I will go . Lunch concludes with a vow to find better salad in greener pastures .

Now you actually have a place to park your damned car ! We have been waiting on this Matt location to open for quite some time to the point where they were so far past their originally projected launch date that I had almost forgotten about it . And then just on a whim browsing through Yelp I noticed that it had quietly opened its doors back in January . Honestly there is not really anything I can say about Matt that I did not say in my review of the original location . The breakfast served here is what I consider to be the gold standard . It traditional breakfast food that thrives on simplicity without the need to be annoyingly trendy with stupid gimmicks like 500 different types of omelets or offering up liquor at 7am in the morning . Keep it simple keep it good and ultimately you do not need all that other crap to keep customers coming back for more . Now if you are used to only going to breakfast places that offer a Bible - sized menu of dishes to select from this might not be the place for you . In my opinion you really cannot go wrong with anything including the thick cuts of peppered bacon butter - infused hash browns homemade jam and various honey lemonades and orange juice . The quality of the food at this location is consistent with what we have come to expect . If you come during busy weekend hours do not expect the addition of an extra location to have an impact on wait times . It just one of those things that we have all learned to tolerate . Good food cannot always be kept secret unfortunately . In some ways I do see this location as kind of an odd choice . It not really very far from the other Matt so it not like anyone is pocketing all this extra gas money by going here instead of downtown . But in the end who really cares? Matt could open up a location at the bottom of a tar pit and I would still give them five stars for the food alone . It simply the best ! ',\n",
       " 'The Venetian is like the mini - Venice . Very pretty and graphic hotel . You gotta admire the thought the effort the imagination the design and the roominess in their suites . Quite painful to reserve it (chi - chiiiiing) but with 4 people with an advanced booking it not a bad stay for an interesting weekend in LV . I did not like the help - desk people (no - smiles ; stinky faces) and I hated the fact that the bella - suites (2 queens) did not have fridges ! THOUGHT#1 : \"if you consider yourself a 4 + star hotel and have pretty high prices have a freaking fridge in the freaking suites\" ! Back to the review . I loved their bathroom restrooms I loved the view towards the small pool on the Venezia Lobby - floor . The corridors are pretty fun to run to jump and take pictures . There are some psychotic security guards who see a girl (me) dressed up from head to toe and checks for my key in case I was an \"intruder\" (logic = 0 with some people) . I loved their shoppe area the fake sky is something to admire once you step into that place you lose your sense of time regardless is 9 :00am or 3 :00am it still blue and \"naturally\" fake . The casino : uninspiring the TAO ; had better restaurants : overpriced but good quality (refer to the specific upcoming reviews)The Venezia Lobby - Pool area is quite relaxing . You would see some families with their noisy kids THOUGHT #2 : \"why would you come with your family to LV? Very puzzling to me\" Other than that it was the best chillaxing area . The pool gets warm from the weather there were some annoying people who thought that they owned the pool and they took over the place but me and my friends managed to take back some parts of it . Not a bad choice to stay but I m considering on my second visit to LV the Palazzo instead . Ciao',\n",

       " 'Eggslut . . . you had me eating every last crumb ! This is located inside the Cosmopolitan . We came here for breakfast and waited in a pretty long line . They have the menu in a couple spots so you can already start drooling over what you want . My husband has had Eggslut before but for me this was a first . I ordered the Bacon egg and cheese . It was literally the best breakfast sandwich I have had . Whatever sauce they used is what made the sandwich . The bacon was crisp and the bun was fluffy yet firm . My husband ordered the Gaucho sandwich which he says they do not have over where we live . He loved it as well and said it beats out all the other stuff he has tried . They were quick with orders and also serve beer ! Which is a good tip since your in Vegas and I am sure you might want one in the morning . The water is also a little cheaper than the surrounding vendors . ',\n",
       " 'Prior to Sunnyslope Art Walk I decided a drink was in order . After all what is the point of walking without drinking . Otherwise I would be driving the Art Walk and then they would have to change the name to Art Drive and no one would go . So Central Grille with it generous parking fit the bill . We sat on the patio which is quite nice once the table with the screaming brat exited . By then I really needed that drink . They have a great happy hour with $5 glasses of house wine $3 . 50 well drinks and import or draft beer . The house wines were not appealing to me but all of their wine prices are quite reasonable although the by - the - glass selection is limited . We ordered two appetizers at only $5 each . However they were small so definitely order more than one unless you are the girl that never eats in front of your guy . I m not that girl . We had the artisan cheese plate and the fig jam crostini . The cheese plate included a blue cheese a goat cheese and a third soft cheese (some kind of cream cheese) . The cranberry - walnut bread was a nice touch even if the cheeses were somewhat ordinary . The fig jam crostini was so crazy delicious though with carmelized onion and melted gorgonzola as well . My husband wanted dinner but since I did not think there would be sofas along the art walk we opted to have only an entree no side dishes . I went with the stuffed salmon . The stuffing was made with crab meat . Unfortunately the salmon was undercooked around the stuffing . Had I been resting after dinner instead of walking I might have actually sent it back something I rarely do . The happy hour portion of service was actually a little slow considering the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived but our server was friendly . All in all an enjoyable time . ',\n",
       " 'Dive bar with a very rude bartender . I asked him to turn up the music a little and in jest I said what do I have to do buy a round for everyone to get it louder? I went back to shooting pool add the music remained the same . When I went to settle up he had charged me for four shots . He charged me for a round of shots for his friends . Another patron informed me that after I walked away they all did a round of shots that were put on my tab . If he was going to do that he could have told me and included me at least . Besides not turning up the music he charged me to give his friends shots when he knew I was not serious . ',\n",

It conveniently located by one of my offices . It so close that I could smell the Animal Fries from across the parking lot . I think that I would be here a lot more but it so damn busy . The drive thru lines are long . The lines inside is even longer . A typical order for me is a Double Double (spread only & extra toast) with fries and an extra Cheeseburger (also with spread only & extra toast) . Lately I have been sticking to just two Flying Dutchman (4 patties 4 cheese) . Overall I cannot complain . The lines may be long but always worth it .

       " 'If you want breakfast food go to Eggyday Noodles . To dine by the river I recommend Estuary Noodles . And if you wanna see a stage production about how the nation is being lied to and manipulated try Edgyplay Noodles . If you want a place to pull your Greyhound Bus into at the terminal try Emptybay Noodles . And if you are feeling horny try Entryway Noodles . But this is none of these . What to get : Mango Milk Tea w Pudding and Lychee Jelly . What not to get : A drink much better than your friend because it might make them jelly . What else : Where did that cute Mango?How to improve : Offer small sizes in bubble teas and make them a slightly better product . Erryday Noodles is not the kind of place I would come erryday especially not for Bubble Tea because well I do not want my stomach to be the size of Pittsburgh . I have yet to try their food but one of these days I shall . At first I was going to give them 5 stars for bubble tea but over the year or two since I first tried it I have had a thousand bubble teas and my taste has become somewhat more refined . All I can say now is that it good but not amazing . I would put several (including Love Yogurt I - Tea and Sumi ) significantly ahead of it in the Burgh Bubble Battles . Speaking of Bubbles the tapioca itself in here is a bit rubber and tasteless even though the drinks are pretty good . Milk tea is average but some of the other products taste better such as Mango Milk with Pudding and Lychee Jelly . I do like the prices which are larger than anywhere in the area and for less money . I also love the service at EN which is always friendly prompt and courteous . And if you just came here for a cup of tea do not bother . You should have gone to Earlgrey Noodles . ',\n",

I had a chicken super burrito and the thing was a full step below taco bell . The chicken was drenched in some sort of creamy goop and I could not tell what else was in the burrito . Totally gross . Go to Taco Bell if you want crappy mexican food and go here if you want to be even more disappointed . I have begun to wonder about some of the review I see about this place and others . Are people really this out of it to think this is 5 star food? People must have really low standards or maybe just dumb in general . ',\n",

I love the food but the service has been lacking and most of the times I have gone to this locations they do not have the salsa bar stocked and or the drinks are out . This location is just across the street from where I live on Eastern and is also in the same parking lot as Jamba Juice Panda Express and 24 Hour Fitness . I come to this location more often now then before because of the location and it very convenient for me to just walk a few minutes and get some food fast . I always order the chicken tacos (in my opinion some of the best chicken tacos I have ever had ! ) and have at times ordered the Carna Asada Burrito or the Carna Asada fries . Both are also very good . Food always comes out quickly . Never have waited more then 5 - 8 minutes for an order which is always a big plus + + . Cons for this location :1 . They could make sure the salsa bar is always stocked especially during rush hours . 2 . Drink Ice machine needs to be always filled as well . 3 . The times that I have gone there are always dirty tables . 4 . They also need to run a c or at least a fan in their shop . It always so stuffy and hot whenever I go there . Other then that it a great place to get food fast . ',\n",

Anyways we got there and instantly started slamming drinks because . . . . Vegas . It almost ended when It began because I guess I slapped our hostess ass when she walked by . After having a shotgun start we decided we wanted to slow down a little so we ordered some brews . You could say we got a good deal . . . 18 beers for $275 bucks . About an hour into our Encore beach club experience my diabetic friend passed out . I could not tell if it was because he was blacked out or because he had a low blood sugar .

       " 'To the owners of Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken I would like to offer my heartfelt apologies just in case the spirit of my dearly departed grandmother appears and hits you with her cast iron skillet . Yes . . . your chicken is that good . As a transplant from the Great American Southeast I am somewhat of a chicken snob and have been continually amazed at the lack of quality fried fowl west of the Mississippi . One of my fondest childhood memories is of grandma cast iron skillet fried chicken . Every Thursday night was chicken night and man could she fricassee a bird . It was not a meal as much as it was an event . After joining the Navy in the 80 (yeah I m and old dude) and moving to San Diego I realized that the only easily attainable fried chicken was from the Colonel . It may have been good stuff a long time ago when he was fryin it up himself at his roadside diner but in the decades that have followed Pepsi Co . has done an excellent job of turning it into an over - salted polymer - laced fast food facsimile of a bone - in Chicken McNugget . Put another way . . . yuck . Having recently moved to Summerlin Las Vegas my wife and I have spent our weekends exploring the Valley ample food scene . To my chagrin however all the highly touted chicken joints in town have fallen flat . It seemed as if we were doomed to seek what pleasure we could from a greasy bucket of corporate squab emblazoned with the Colonel evil grinning face . I can almost see him in his secret control room under Mount Charleston laughing maniacally as he watches us on the mini - cam inserted in one of our thighs by regional marketing . Yeah I know he is dead . . . or is he?Then just today as I was strolling through Downtown Summerlin wondering what I would have for lunch I stumbled upon Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken . \"How good could this possibly be \" I thought to myself as I stopped to look at the menu . After all I am sure it is just a KFC in disguise . Skepticism aside I was intrigued so I threw caution to the wind went in and ordered their \"Two Thigh\" dinner . I waited about 10 minutes for my meal and when it arrived it was fresh and beautifully prepared . If you are a connoisseur of chicken you know when you see a special piece of bird and this was one of those moments . I had not seen such a thigh since Baywatch was cancelled . This is where Grandma starts getting mad . . . The coating was crisp well - seasoned and created a wonderful shell for the moist and tender thigh meat inside . I doused my first bite with an ample portion of wildflower honey and began slip back in time . I looked into the open kitchen and just for a moment thought I saw grandmother working the fryer . This was good stuff . After a couple more bites of my glorious bird I tasted my side of collard greens and was pleased to see that Blue Ribbon had gotten them right too . It tasted just like it had come out of a South Georgia pressure cooker . Grandma is really beside herself at this point . . . Finally I took a deep swig of iced tea and was pleased to discover that Blue Ribbon knew their brew . Tea is extremely important in the south . We drink it more than Budweiser at a NASCAR race and it can make or break a meal . In these days of soda fountain tea - flavored chemicals a Pepsi Co . invention no doubt finding an establishment that serves real tea is always refreshing . Grandma is now raising the skillet over her head . . . In the final analysis I have determined that Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken may well make some of the best fried chicken I have had the pleasure of consuming . Grandma swings . . . I am not sure if it is fast food or not but in the words of the late Justin Wilson it is so good you will want to stand up an slap someone . . . but do not . . . just enjoy your meal . Grandma pan finds its target . . . sorry guys . ',\n",

       " 'Finally made it to the Original Pancake House never been but have heard they do carry a selection of different pancakes . I have wanted to check out this place I host an monthly breakfast club that runs on Sat and though that this could be a cool place to check out but when reading the menu it clearly states that they can host parties of up to 30 people but on WEEKDAYS only well guess this place is out of the BC loop . When I 1st walked in a few things hit me1) Plenty of signs on the door inside the place and around the place that elude you to believe it a cash only place and they have an ATM inside the joint but on the door it states they take Visa & MasterCard yep skipped the ATM fee and I ponied up the Visa2) Did I just go to Miami? The inside of the place is painted as a cool little beach diner white cream and aqua colors but like a 50 cool diner this was not an new place3) Signs stating to turn off Cell phones um ok I understand that in a small room it would be sort of rude to carry on a conversation but people can text and well play games my phone was set to silent and while I was waiting to be waited on I did text & play a game 4) Hope the people around you are friendly because they are sitting just an elbow bump away but it was ok with us had a nice couple next to us and he commented on how it like dinning on a cruise being close to fellow diners . 5) I being 40 felt like the new kid on the block so I m guess my daughter who is 22 felt really young hahaAlso again on being close to everyone you can hear what others are ordering or not ordering and on the menu it stated that the house specialty is the Apple Pancake and I was interested in trying it but overheard another table inquiring about it and they were told it was a 45 min wait for the Apple Pancakes and it not that I was in a rush I just was not into waiting 45 mins to try it maybe call a head for it? After checking out the menu and yes they have a few different types of pancakes but nothing really wowed me but I did see a Bacon stuffed pancake and you betcha that what I ordered and ordered a side of home fries . The pancakes come with real butter and 2 ounces of syrup for me that was not enough I like a little bit of pancake with my sweet sticky maple syrup I did ask for more but it still was not enough some most of the pancakes were dry and I do not like them that way but the bacon was a thick slice bacon so very good bacon and maple syrup is the best combo ever ! The home fries looked amazing but they were under cooked the potatoes were a little to hard for me . Service was slow it was weekday morning so the place was semi steady we were not check on to see if we needed wanted anything but after 5 mins of getting our food our bill was presented to us and I was told we can take care of that at the front kind of felt like it was a hurry up eat and get out kind of thing . Glad I finally stopped by to check them out but even with the few types of pancakes I m not sure I will be back . ',\n",

Layers of cake & chocolate mousse where the perfect blend and cured my sweet tooth for sure !

I love the crust the cheese is not gooey and the toppings work . We are talking buffet here folks so gluttony is the word of the day .

The staff is friendly as you should find at all locations . This staff seemed extra attentive . Do not see the pizza you had in mind on the buffet line? Ask and they will have one for you quicker than you would expect . Tell them the number of slices you would like or just ask for the whole thing . The tables were clean .

       " 'I visited this place in both locations Mont Royal and Vieux Port . Both restaurant have the same food menu both have an amazing terasse and both have an amazing and fast service . I tryed the dinner menu at the Mont Royal twice and the selection is very big : a choice of soup cold and hot dishes . The buns are amazing and you can only find them on the dinner menu . For lunch and at both locations they offer the table d hote at a very convenient price . I always start with the Soupe Coco . It an amazing soup . Then I often order those tasty vegetarian spring rolls . As main course I tried the coconut salmon a very light and parfumated taste . Their Pad Thai is a home made (done from scratch) so you know that you wont be able to compare it to any of the other Pad Thai you will find in Montreal . My recommendations for the main course is the Grilled 1855 Beef Satay Sauce Crispy Brocoli . Its a mouthwatering piece of meat with fried brocoli a sauce that is to die for and at the end of your meal you feelthat you had something different and yet very fulling . Their dessert are fine . I suggest you try to taste everything on the menu . It is a place I would go every time I need to have some exotic gateway . Also for a 5@7 their drink are amazing a different taste everytime in a very nice and modern decor . This place is a coup de coeur . ',\n",

       " 'My friend and I came here during Memorial Day Weekend . We came during the transition between brunch to dinner time (but we paid dinner prices) so it was really nice to be able to eat a bit of everything . I remember thinking it was a very decent price for a Vegas Buffet . . . but then I was not too impressed when it came down to the food . I just gathered a bit of everything to take *a bite* and the only thing that I really enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese shrimp cocktail & crab legs ! ! After the experimental plates I just filled up on the expensive stuff to get my money worth ! ! I also wanted to try the prime rib but my friend said her slice was over cooked even though she asked for a medium medium - rare cut . I saw all of the meats and it DID look too over cooked so I passed on the prime rib . What a disappointment . . . I was especially unsatisfied with their dessert selection . . . I gathered all the pretty desserts that would fit on a plate : macaroons eclairs tarts and a chocolate covered strawberry . . . but it was all so mediocre . . . Most items only got one bite from me . I took a double taste on the flan but I was still not impressed . The only dessert I finished was this Cappuccino shooter (minus the whipped cream on top) . ',\n",

All of their signatures have fruit in or served with the meal . They have got chamangos (which are a must try) and elotes they also have fruit platters and crepes . Lots of different drink options for sure . I really am a big fan of crepes and trust me when I say they have mastered the crepe here (it soft and delicious) . It ONLY $5 . 99 ! What a STEAL ! Comes with your choice of two different fruit toppings and they have nutella or cinnamon . But seriously this is an excellent place to go to for dessert . I just wish I knew about them before . It definitely a small mom and pop shop that a hidden gem but that what I love most about it . It will really make your mouth water ! ',\n",
       " 'I just found Las Vegas best kept secret . The vibe at Vintner Grill is old glam Hollywood where white leather sofas dark Old English bar art deco chandeliers and dimly lit candles meets crystal floor lamps . white linens black and white classic movies and a wine list and menu featuring fabulous picks what more can I ask for? Phew - I m outa breath ! Ambiance Ambiance ! However with that being said it did lack some jazzy background music which would have been the perfect touch . I recommend you dress to impress and request a table in the main dining room so you get the whole experience and people watch . We were tucked away near the cozy wine cellar where it was quiet but I did miss the table candle and some movie watching . There is some outdoor seating complete with fire - pit and twinkling lights too . If you do not want a table the bar section is also a roomy option to sit and have dinner or a cocktail . On this night we were out celebrating Kate birthday so we started off with some refreshing libations that were featured on the menu . I chose my usual Lemon Drop Martini . I always request it a bit more sweeter that sour . Pear martini grapefruit vodka and a fresh ginger vodka concoction was served up in a copper mug for our party of four . The menu changes a bit with the seasons and that always a good thing . For starters we chose a fabulous Charcuterie . The wonderful thing about this choice selection is that you pick out your favorite meats cheeses dried fruits spreads . Can you say Nom Nom Nom? Served up in a traditional wood board our selection of Lavender Goat Cheese Manchego Dried Salami Prosciutto Dates Dried Apricots Honey and Berry Jam and a basket of bread - BUT I do wish portions were a bit bigger and more bread was in the basket - BUT then I would not have had room for our incredible Calamari Misto complete with battered lemon wedges and a yummy aioli dipping sauce . Everything was delicious . Choosing our entree for dinner was a hard choice because the surf and turf Mediterranean choices all sounded mouth - watering . Hmmm Halibut? Sea Bass Scallops? Butternut Squash Risotto? Salmon? Braised Short Rib Ravioli? Bouillabaisse? Decisions Decisions ! The food was all so elegantly served with so much love . I enjoyed every bite of my scallops and my hubby ravioli . MMMM . Service was a bit on the super slow side but I do not like to feel rushed especially on a special occasion and your reservation here seems like its yours all night - because were here for about three hours drinking eating laughing drinking eating laughing . The nice thing was that I did see a few well - behaved children - so I m always liking a place where you are not looked at cross - eyed for bringing in family . The Sommelier helped to pick out a good wine and nice smooth Cabernet was delivered . Appropriate stemware was brought out too . Ginormous crystal wine glasses that allowed you to sniff swirl and see the \"legs\" of the wine were much appreciated . Dessert was not left out and we shared a fresh gourmet strawberry \"shortcake\" type of dessert which was delightful . A candle was placed on Kate dessert so that was nice . http : www . yelp . com biz_photos vintner - grill - las - vegas?userid = uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ#_4NDGgI_Y1ckFS1jz9v_tQOverall a fun evening with friendly helpful staff .

       " 'Its no secret that Im as cheap as it gets and any place that serves up a delicious hot breakfast for $2 is more than alright by me . Seriously nothing gets me fired up quite like a sweat deal - and good luck trying to find a better deal than this . We are talking eggs your choice of breakfast meats (i personally prefer the sausage) home fries toast and coffee . $2 bucks - straight up . I mean - seriously . . . $2 bucks ! You cant even buy a back alley BJ for that price anymore . And I promise you that if you can it wont be nearly as satisfying as this breakfast . . ',\n",
       " 'I will start this off with the good news the food here is really good . I enjoyed everything I tried while I was there . Everything had tons of flavor great texture and fun presentation . That what is boosted the rating an extra star . This place lost a lot of stars because of the service or lack there of especially with rude guests in the place . We arrived at dinner time and had to wait for a table for a few minutes . This was ok because it was obvious they were busy . We were eventually seated at a nice table . The music was loud and going for a party atmosphere but it was the ok loud level most of us deal with on a regular basis . That was until the party of 15 were sat behind us . They the abnormally obnoxious group obviously were tourists who think it is ok to behave like jerks everywhere they go because \"It Vegas Baby ! \" The whole group were drinking like crazy and acting like fools . They were screaming and hollering and making all of the surrounding tables feel uncomfortable . I know this because we talked to the tables on either side of us and we all though they were acting like idiots . It got to the point where it was hard to talk to the person sitting right next to you because it was so loud . Im pretty sure several tables asked a manager to ask the group to quiet down a bit . Every now and then you would hear someone from the group apologize for being loud right before they started screaming again . Annoying . Our server was also blah . She was hardly present and did the bare minimum our entire stay . We hardly saw her except to order and receive our food . She was then gone until she dropped off the bill . Bad bad service . Something that really annoyed me was the dessert options . My 4 year old daughter asked for a scoop of ice cream . I understand that was not on the menu but I figured I would ask anyway . I was in the food & bev business for a long time and I know everywhere I worked you could order a scoop of ice cream as long as the place had ice cream from casual to fine dining . Our server said they do not do any side orders at all . Since I had already promised her ice cream (thats a different story but ice cream was a must) I had to order her a $15 HUGE do it yourself sundae thing that is meant for 4 - 6 people . I thought this was just bad taste and bad customer service . And annoyed me even more . So the food is really good and totally \"Flavor Town\" level as GF says on his foodie shows so yay for good food . If I ever go back it definitely will be during the day because later is just obnoxious unless you are 21 and in a frat perhaps . ',\n",
       " 'My wife and I eat here regularly but most recently we had a life changing experience at Paco . We recently had a child and while that seems like a useless piece of information it is until it isnt . You see we had yet another sleep - deprived night last night (as all good parents do) and our beautiful demon baby could not stop screeching all morning . It a Saturday morning so what do we normally do? Oh Home Depot Bed Bath and Beyond we will see . Might get a little crazy . Well after we called our parents and both sets of them laughed at us they gave us some of the best parental advice that been passed down from generation to generation . . . drive her around ! So we did . Plopped our little porkchop into her tank of a car seat (have you seen these things recently? That why mom in south Charlotte do not need to hit the gym . Doing curls with a 25# car seat will give you guns to rival Arnold) and off went . Magically it worked ! After cruising the mean streets of South Charlotte for an hour we realized that we broke the cardinal rule of new parenting : do not forget to eat and drink plenty of water . My wife realized she did not eat for the last 3 meals ! What are we to do? I flipped up the Yelp app (product placement) and we decided to stuff our faces with South Park finest Mexican Pacos Tacos . We were nervous we were going to be the only ones there at 11 :05AM looking completely haggard from a tough night . The good news? That where all new parents go for the \"early bird special\" . We were even more nervous that our hellion was going to lose it and we were going to be \"those parents\" . You know the ones who let their kid wail in the middle of church because they could not properly manage their kid blood sugar? Well Pacos had us covered there too . The dull roar of the kitchen and Willie Nelson soothing tunes kept our daughter quiet during our entire meal . (Yes the ENTIRE meal)Bless you Paco you saved the day . You know what else is great? Getting the first food served of the day . My wife fajitas were perfect . The unholy guacamole lived up to it name . My steak quesadilla burrito two tacos and enchiladas? Hot delicious and made with love . (So what I m a stress eater . . . want to fight about it?) Later that day we all made it home safely our daughter slept for another hour and my wife and I well we got the best hour nap of our week . Thank you Pacos we are customers for life ! ',\n",

We had have so much love for Children Hospitals (Radys in San Diego mostly ! ) I knew that I would have to come down and get lunch . I went with a regular #13 (Italian Sub) chips (Doritos) and a drink (Wild Cherry Pepsi) . My total was just over $11 . 00 . The sandwich was tasty ! I had them hook it up with extra oil and vinegar . The bread was soft the meats were plentiful and I loved the extra oil and vinegar . It made the bread really soft and provided great flavor ! It definitely hit the spot ! Doritos are always good and the drink was alright (Coke fan here) . Service was friendly and I enjoyed my lunch . Super awesome that all of todays proceeds are going to a great cause too ! I hope they do this every year ! As long as they do I will definitely be back ! ',\n",

We came in for their restaurant week menu and it was lovely . What I do not really understand is the direction of the menu . It part Mediterranean part Italian . But which is it?

       " 'I had been anticipating the opening of Bonus Round after hearing that a new \"barcade\" was in the works in the midtown Phoenix area . After all nothing goes together better than drinking and video games ! I decided to wait a few weeks to let the initial hype die down so I could fully appreciate the experience and I have to say IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT ! Last night I made my first appearance and felt right at home when I walked in . The interior has a very raw but welcoming feel with classic arcade games scattered about and handwritten menus drink lists on chalkboards hanging from the walls . My first dilemma was what drink to order first : the beer selection is very impressive but the handcrafted cocktails cleverly named after video game themes appealed more to the kid in me . Naturally I ordered the Barrel Roll a whiskey based cocktail with ginger root . AMAZING . I was not very hungry but after spying hand battered deep fried pickles on the menu I decided to treat myself to a little snack . ALSO AMAZING (with a little bit of a spicy kick as well) . After ordering my second cocktail the Dry Heat (a spicy tequila based drink also amazing) I decided to try my hand at some arcade games . First of all I loved the fact that everything is free play . It a brilliant business decision because it made me want to stay longer and that equals more money spent on more drinks and food . The game selection is pretty decent and it was relatively easy to play all the games I wanted despite the large crowd . Everyone seemed to be considerate of letting others play . The staff was incredible ; our bartenders (Johnny and the other gentleman whose name I never caught) were both very helpful in helping us select our drinks all evening and answering our million questions regarding different beers cocktails and spirits . That kind of attentiveness to the customer in that busy environment does not go unnoticed and I was extremely impressed ! To wind this long review up I will just say that last night was one of the most fun nights I have had in Phoenix in a while and I will 100% without a doubt be back very soon as I m very determined to beat my Spy Hunter record ! My only suggestions would be to turn the music up just a bit to create more of an atmosphere ; nothing crazy loud obviously you want to be able to have a conversation . At one point when I was killing it at Galaga a really good song came on and I remember thinking \"I wish this was a little louder I would SO be in my zone right now\" . And second use that projector for something amazing ! Other barcades I have been to will project movies or video games on the wall for customers to play consoles like playstation or xbox on a giant screen (or wall in this case) . ',\n",

On my most recent stop I got the Il Purista sandwich which is one of my favorites the fresh mozzarella with pungent fresh basil roasted peppers and the great Prosciutto come together in a flavor overload on a great sandwich roll . How fresh and high end the ingredients stand out especially with the mozzarella as it has a much more distinct and rich flavor and texture than the more bland store bought stuff . I also added a cannoli to my order which was great . A lot of places make cannoli that is just too sweet and this was the right mix of sweet and savory . The other nice part was that it had just enough chocolate chips to provide a good flavor without overpowering the sweet shell and creamy ricotta . In past trips I have gotten the meatball sub chicken parm sub and the pasta and meatballs . I can tell you that you cannot go wrong with any of it . ',\n",

First of all you will get cancer the second you walk into Bob Taylor . Even with just a few customers the place reeked of everyone favorite combination : stale cigarettes and fresh cigarettes . On top of that the place was dark dingy and depressing . I felt like I was in an old bowling alley . The only difference is that old bowling alleys serve somewhat edible food . Not only was my hamburger a once frozen patty the steak fries had less flavor than water . I would have loved to try the coleslaw instead of the fries but it was not prepared yet ! Why do I have a feeling the cook is on a morning - long smoke break . . . . . inside the restaurant ! ?The only reason I am not giving Bob Taylor a single star is because the bacon on my burger was nice and thick .

       " '3 . 5 STARSFirst meal during this past Vegas trip . We dropped by for dinner on Wednesday July 8th around 8 :30pm . No reservation and a party of 5 . We were seated right away . Drinks :*Watermelon sling : High west silver oak whiskey fresh pressed watermelon juice & fresh lemon with aperol ($14)*Southern revival : sweet and sour featuring wild turkey 81 passion fruit basil ($14)*Yardbird old fashioned : bacon - infused buffalo trace bourbon angostura bitters orange bitters maple syrup ($15)*Albert collins : absolut Avion reposado and spring 44 old tom gin ($15)*Df evocation ($7)After drinking all day I could only stomach a cocktail . My choice of the Watermelon sling was perfect . Light and easy to drink . I nursed this the whole dinner . Food :*Deviled eggs : fresh chive smoked trout roe are dneck caviar ($11)*Bbq pork belly : 4oz house pork belly sherry apple glaze sliced pickle salad ($14)*Iceberg wedge : crisp iceberg lettuce fresh corn tomatoes house - smoked bacon avocado gaba goo dressing ($14)*St Louis style pork ribs : tender slow - cooked house bbq sauce ($32)*Shrimp n grits : Florida shrimp crisp Virginia ham Nora mill granary grits ($28)*Chicken n watermelon n waffles : yardbird signature old school fried chicken honey hot sauce chilled spiced watermelon cheddar cheese chow chow waffle bourbon maple syrup ($36 + $8 one thigh)*Skillet cornbread : cheddar bacon jalapeno maple butter ($9)*Macaroni & cheese : torchio pasta five artisanal cheeses crispy herb crust ($10)My favorite dish was the mac and cheese . Just the perfect amount of creaminess and crustiness . I finished off the dish since I liked it so much . Second fav was the shrimp and grits . The grits were kind of chunky with I enjoyed . The shrimp tender and flavorful . Of course I had to get a salad . Not the best wedge salad I have had . Felt like the corn made it too busy but it added the refreshing element I needed when eating all the heavy food . The found the mains of ribs and chicken okay . They were a little dry in my opinion . But with the chicken I m normally a thigh fan and ended up with a breast so that may have been the reason . I did like the flavor of the breading though . That what I get for eating slowly and grabbing a piece of chicken last ! The deviled eggs were creamy and huge but I felt the addition of roe just added an unnecessary fishiness . And the pork belly was waaay too tough and sweet . Dessert* Crunch n munch bread pudding popcorn ice cream caramel popcorn pretzel ($10)I only took a bit of this since we ordered dessert . I m not a huge chocolate fan or bread pudding fan so I did not care for this at all . This was probably a case of ordering too much of the wrong dishes . I probably would have enjoyed the bone marrow versus some of the other apps we got . But I believe the fried chicken was good . It was just a shame that I got the wrong kind of piece . But the mac and cheese redeemed it all for me . 3 . 5 rounded up to 4 stars ! ',\n",

We tried the Fried Rice Krisipies which is their take on the spicy tuna - crispy rice dish found elsewhere . This version has black caviar which I love . Their kitchen menu does a great lobster roll order (small but well executed ! ) as well as a flavorful steak frite plate that could easily make a meal . While I have not tried much of the menu I look forward to returning .

       " '3 . 5 stars . . . solid lunch and lots of decent items at reasonable prices . Cafe Neon is popular . . . even on a weekday lunch you can find this spot quite filled up and on a weekend I have been told that the wait is easily 30 + minutes . Though it is not a big spot you can find a table of 4 still works in the back . Another plus of this spot is that the front does coffees to go . . . I didnt give it a shot (I had a great flat white further west at Major Treat) it a spot I can try out next time . Most of the seating is behind in another room and the coffee take out area is in front . I got lucky and was seated quickly in a super cozy spot . I think most people would not like it as it was just stool seating in the front window . For me it works as I got to dog and people watch while eating my lunch . The place is really low key and casual . . . its not hipsterish but I could easily see other people suggest it is . I would say it more of a casual local and low key spot . The service here is a bit . . . scattered and not because they didnt care but because all tables were super filled and they were trying to move the tables quickly . They are nice but just really busy . We got our order in but we did wait a bit long seeing how we ordered the vegetarian seasonal salad bowl and a soup & sandwich . I would say the kitchen was probably just trying to push so many orders out . Seasonal Bowl (Vegetarian) - I saw another person said this was flavourless so I was worried ordering this . I think my bowl was far better than theirs then . Mine was nicely dressed with a light vinaigrette and there was a ton of variety of vegetables . Sprouted grains rocket green sprouts beets kale sweet potato almonds . . . the list goes on . It was a BIG and brightly coloured salad . . . Loved the variety and did I say it was BIG? HUGE . Great portion for the costs . . . one of the better ones for this side of Toronto . Did I like it more than Veghed or The Goods which is nearby? No . . . not quite . It was just missing a flavour wow compared to the other 2 . THOUGH I would have no problems ordering this any time . 3 . 5 5Pulled Pork Sandwich - This one was far more smokier than I was expecting out of a little cafe . . . and that not a bad thing . It was tender pork that had a good smokey flavour . How do they do it without a smoker? I dunno but it was a good sandwich especially with the onion bread chipotle mayo slaw and coffee bbq sauce . The sandwich bun seemed a bit smaller but it under $10 . Ca not really complain for Toronto . 4 5Mushroom Soup - A really nice bowl who flavour looks far better than looks . It looks more like a murkish grey puddle . With a lot of chopped mushrooms in it it was very savoury and had tons of bold flavour . I felt the chef probably was heavy handed with the black pepper so it was probably a bit too much spice to it than I would have liked . Still an enjoyable soup . 3 . 5 5Overall this is a great spot to try if you are in the area and looking for a solid and affordable meal . There a decent amount of options for vegans vegetarians and omnivores so you can always find something . Just be a bit patient for the food and all would be fine . ',\n",

We sat at a table where we could see the line - - it was continually long up until we left at around 2pm . With all the waiting and the lines you would think this place is really off the chain . No ! It was not . Food was mediocre and the actual restaurant is quite small . It seemed like the carts were scarce and we were constantly stopping the same carts over and over again . Price was decent but not worth the money for the so - so food . I wanted to like Ping Pang Pong . . . Everyone even locals have told me this place is good but I did not like it .

       " 'An overall regrettable dining experience . The hostess was unapproachable or dare I say \"bitchy . \" Also we had no server once we were seated - a random server came up to us to let us know explicitly that he was not our server but he will take our drink orders . As we were ready to order we also had to place our order with our not - so - server but we kept having to flag him down to ask questions about the menu . I was irritated since we did not receive a proper introduction recommendation or detailed explanation of the menu . Unfortunately we were seated in a booth that shares the same corner as the staff registers - what an awkward set - up . While we waited for our dinner we heard loud and clear server conversations ; bickering and critiquing each - other . We also could not avoid hearing an earful of servers singing obnoxiously . It not a comfortable ambiance for us to relax in each others presence or even enjoy private conversation . The food was laughable . There was only one dish that we could honestly recommend and it was $13 ghost pepper chicken wings . That it? The menu seems very confused and I m sure the chef is just as confused . Let go through the items we tried :Ghost pepper wings ghost chili BBQ and green ranch chili sauce $13 - Shockingly this was the only item of the evening that we actually enjoyed . I loved the perfect balance of sweetness and the spicy heat offered in the ghost chili BBQ sauce . The ranch consistency was watery but the flavor was unique and delicious . The wings were cooked properly and had a decent amount of moist meat . But seriously . Wings are wings you are not really missing anything here . Flavor rating : 4 5Sticky belly steamed buns $9 - Total white - boy style (in a bad way) we were not a fan of the dry hard bao bun tough overcooked thick cut bacon & weird tangy salad dressing sauce . Also the cabbage slaw looked wilted and brown . I have had my share of tasty baos in Vegas (try : Bachi Burger Gordon Ramsey BurGR Fat Choy) and this sits at the very bottom of the list . This dish needs major work . Blegh . Flavor rating : 2 5Low country shrimp and grits $10 - A serious disappointment . The \"crispy pork belly\" was a prank that was written on the menu description . It actually tiny bits of chopped (hard) bacon . The fishy tiny frozen shrimp was offensively over - salted and lacking substantial cajun flavor . The grits were dry and bland and tasted like oatmeal plus the cheddar cheese was sparse . All amateur mistakes . Flavor rating : 2 5Sweet potato fries with Caribbean ketchup $4 - They arrived at our table room temperature and stale ; we sent them back for a re - do . I was offended that we could not even get freshly fried sweet potatoes and that they offered us unwelcome fries from a heat lamp . The fries were standard the ketchup was unique - but it still nothing to write home about . You may want to go the extra mile and request some of the green chili ranch to pair with these fries - they work well together . Flavor rating : 2 5After a disenchanting dinner we were ready to leave our experience far behind us . This place is not for us and probably not for you either if you appreciate your taste buds .

The salbutes are delightful little cousins to tostadas and are a great starter . The stewed chicken is tender and full of flavor and the Caribbean red snapper is some of the best preparations of the fish I have had in recent years . The whole red snapper is rubbed with spices that taste similar to the Jamaican jerk spice and is shallow fried such that the exterior is crisp and the flesh is succulent .

The waitresses will mock you and you need to be sure you are ready for this ! + I received a \"dance\" by one of the guys here that sat me on a chair and gave me a \"lap dance\" . It was more of an insult and mockery dance . It was hilarious ! The guy ended up showing a G - string thong ! Cost was $40 and well worth it ! + Food here is good . Had a few appetizers burgers etc and it was good . + Fun atmosphere of course . + Drinks were poured heavy . No watered down stuff here . + Price was on par with other places around . Not so good : - Nothing . Overall this is a fun and EXTREMELY unique experience . Just remember not to take anything to heart or too seriously . One of my friends was starting to get irritated with the insults but it nothing personal . It all about having fun ! I highly recommend you try this place out ! ',\n",

       " 'Fukuburger has been around since the first generation of food trucks in Las Vegas . Now they have a brick and mortar right in Chinatown where they first started off . Its got cool artwork on the interior with an easy to read digital menu but the dining space kinda is cramped . We shared a Fukuburger with Jazz Fries and luckily we just ordered one burger to test it out . Everything sounds and looks great but the taste and composition of our items just did not impress me . . . not a fan of whatever additional seasoning marinade is used in the patty and the patty has an odd firm texture to it . The bun is supposed to keep everything in between in tact but liquid from the patty and additional ingredients were soaked up from the bottom and it was a soggy mess . Jazz Fries were not all that jazzy . . . more like a generic poutine without the cheese curds and mayo instead . Um . . . . no . Fukuburger already has a loyal following so I wish them nothing but the best . . . maybe the timing of my visit was not good (Team Fukuburger was catering at an Atlanta Falcons game in the ATL) so maybe quality and cosistency slipped a bit who knows? I just hope that this place is not jinxed from formerly being White Rabbit and Fresh Cup before that . ALOHA ! ! ! Shaka Meter : \\\\uuu \\\\uuu 2',\n",

If she could back ti - yummm . . . ti - yummmmm . Anyway amid the drunken youngsters drinking the bong - shaped decanters of margaritas we suddenly heard the ghostly voice of Celine Dion screeching to us that her heart will go on . My God is not she back in Montreal yet? I avoided Vegas for six years so I would not have to hear that pompous voice of hers . Alas it was the sound system at the Fountains of Bellagio playing her overplayed song as the waters danced to the bombast . Gratefully it was the very end we had to hear so we waited patiently for the next show in fifteen minutes . This time it was Lee Greenwood singing his tribute to Reaganomics - \"God Bless the USA\" - and you can see how those policies have brought us today to near financial ruin . Regardless the fountains are quite a sight especially at night with all the lights adding yet another dimension . Apparently there are three types of nozzles used to make the special effects - oarsmen (jets with a full range of spherical motion) ; shooters (which shoot water upwards) ; and super shooters (which send the water up as high as 250 feet in the air) . Gee that sounds like one of the sex shows that those guys are selling with those cards that they pluck and snap as you pass by . The whole extravaganza lasts about three to four minutes and no worry if you miss one as another show comes in fifteen to thirty minutes depending on the time of day . It quite a dazzler and your only other free option is watching the Sirens of T . I . (Treasure Island) . I am so not in that target audience .

I was surprised how large both the interior and the outdoor patio were . There was plenty of room outside on this nice afternoon and we got a table in the shade . The theming around a school is a gimmick but it OK . That how you make your brand stand out when the food is similar to what you can get any number of places . I got the fried chicken sandwich with fries and an iced tea . Service was quick and friendly . The sandwich was good and the atmosphere was very enjoyable . Iced tea refills were brought without asking and we had a pleasant lunch . Public School 702 is A - OK . ',\n",
       " 'I do not think people understand or at least fully comprehend how much I love Las Vegas . Sure it holds a lot of sentimental value for me but once you get over all the things people HATE Vegas for you realize how amazing this Postmodern Paradise is in all its glory . That said I m so happy that a place like Peppermill exists but pretty disappointed that it taken me 27 years to finally discover and go here . This place is SOOOOOO cheesy Vegas - I know there a Canter in Vegas but if Canter fully embraced the aesthetic of the city it would look like this place . The ceiling walls and columns are adorned with mirrorball tiles the lampshades are stained glass flamingos and every plant i the place is made of plastic . Even the sugar are rainbow sprinkles ! Just do not get too excited and then having to deal with an entire handful of the stuff you have no business really holding . The menu is pretty comprehensive - you have got steak sammies and everything a 24 7 diner - like place should have . Prices are kind of on the steep side but the food is tasty . We went there at 11pm after spending an entire day in the sun with thousands of others watching awesome bands and had nothing to consume all day with the exception of a cup of cereal in the morning and a beer here and there throughout the day . By the time we got there we were all FAMISHED . The varied menu made it hard to choose but I nabbed myself a pastrami sandwich which was perhaps on my top ten list of Best Choices I have Made in My Short Life . It may have been the fact that I was super hungry but I do not exaggerate when I say I was nearly reduced to tears after each bit of my cured meat on sourdough bread I was so happy . I chewed with the biggest smile on my face while a chorus of angels one can hear even past the super loud decor surrounding me . If I was challenged to marry the thing I would have plowed over my boyfriend and dashed to the nearest chapel where Elvis would have married us and our honeymoon would be spent skipping the \"honeymoon\" part and would have gone directly to praying mantis mode and devoured my mate . It was that good . Oh I sampled other peoples food as well and it was all pretty good . But back to my sandwich . I do not know . . . we may have been caught up in the moment maybe it was just good timing . I do not know if I were to return things would be the same but maybe . . . just maybe I will give it a try . ',\n",

This is the best deal in Vegas as it reminds you of the stories of old Vegas - good quality of food at really affordable prices . While we ate our soup and salad the anticipation for the ribs were unbearable ! The open flame grill and the aroma of meat in the air made it difficult to concentrate on what my husband was talking about . The ribs fell off the bone . The meat to bbq sauce ratio was perfect too (if you are not into too much sauce) ! All this food and 4 glasses of beer cost us $49 . SCORE ! !

       " 'Do you want to puke out of your mouth and ass at almost the same time? Then definitely pay the exorbitant price to eat at best mediocre food at the Rio Casino Seafood Buffet ! Perhaps I was asking for it because I went around 8 :45 - the person at the front assured me that they will continue to bring out food until 9 :30 . They did continue to bring out food but the less popular dishes just sat there and sat there . I do not understand why people come here . All you can eat lobster? NOT FOUND . I think I may have found it but thought it was crawfish . All you can eat oysters? NOT FRESH ! Avoid not fresh oyster at all costs . They say oysters are an afrodisiac but there nothing sexy in watching someone puke . All you can eat king crab legs? NOT FOUND . Seriously where was this? I only found snow crab legs . No king crab found . All you can eat seafood? Yes but again not fresh . I found the seafood was more fresh at the Bachannal buffet at Caesars although the variety was not as good as here . But why pay more to eat such crap food? If you are here strictly for quantity or you are someone who likes to puke after eating a ton of food I can kind of understand . . Even if I did not get sick I would not suggest coming here . Spend the extra to go to Bachannal at Caesars - it so much better and has enough seafood options to keep you satisfied . If you did the Buffet of Buffets promotion it definitely not worth the extra fee to eat here . So after I became ill someone suggest that I contact customer service . I sent them an email telling them that I got food poisoning from their buffet and they replied asking me to call some risk management team and they will open up an investigation . I would have preferred if they just refunded the extra money I paid as part of their Buffet of Buffets deal . But calling their number and speaking with them for a mere $10 is not worth the effort . So Rio you win . Take my $10 . I hope my puke and crap somehow clog up your sewage pipes . ',\n",

The place is huge with rows and rows of machines some super - vintage . Most of the machines especially the older and more obscure ones have handwritten cards that list the year it came out and some history about the game . My friends and I were particularly taken with a German pinball machine from the 60s called Campus Queen . This place is obviously a labor of love : they do not charge admission and as far as I can tell your quarters and whatever you spend on their vending machines are their only source of income . There are plenty of change machines everywhere but it does not look like they have AC - - just a bunch of ceiling fans . We were lucky to be there on a nice cool night but I imagine it could really swelter in typical Vegas weather . Also no alcohol allowed - - it all just good clean fun ! The Simpsons and South Park pinball machines totally screwed me but I somewhat redeemed myself with the Centipede machine ; my friends and I had a blast !

       " 'Great buffet for the price - downtown Las Vegas ! I dislike buffets and what I dislike more is paying for parking to dine at the establishment . Many of the casinos now require parking in their garage at the Strip or parking lot at the Fremont Street Experience so in order to get free parking we needed to dine in one of the casino restaurants to get our parking ticket validated . This buffet is located inside the Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel at the Fremont Street Experience . Actually this buffet was not too bad . We arrived almost closing time at 9 :45p but the buffet is open for another 30 minutes after they closed at 10 :00p . Saturday was Prime Rib & Scampi Special . I m not certain and cannot remember how much we paid . The prime rib from the carving station was tender tasty and delicious . The food was your typical buffet menu but this one had Hawaiian fare including pork kālua plus more at the very end and I saw it only after I got full from my first serving . I also had menudo . Yum ! All the food I had was fresh and well heated . Dinner and parking validation . . . we will take it ! The dining area is in an airy room with Victorian decor . Our server was nice and friendly and always readily refilling our drinks and clearing our used plates from our table . There were not that many diners at this hour nearing closing time so she was attentive to our table . I m still not fond of buffets but this experience at the Fremont Street Experience was alright . A gem in downtown Vegas . With our validated parking we walked to Fremont Street Experience right after for some music entertainment from the live cover bands . . . Review #0836',\n",

The interior decor is modern contemporary and pleasant to the sight . We ordered a bunch of dishes on the HH menu to share . The portions are relatively small but the prices are reasonable compared to the other sushi restaurants on the strip . The flavors are creative presentation was nice service was fast and efficient . We probably ordered one of each item on the pretty extensive HH menu and enjoyed every dish . Drinks were pretty tasty also . Definitely recommend ! ',\n",
       " 'Think about Yard House but with a school theme better food and a more limited drink menu . LOCATION & ATMOSPHERELocated in Downtown Summerlin little circle of restaurants and random rock formation fountain Public School 702 gives off that perfect local hangout vibe . It always poppin every time I have been . The restaurant itself is very large and they really stick to the schoolhouse vibe (the menus are super cute composite notebooks ! ) . It obvious Public School 702 is a recent addition to an already successful chain of restaurants . I love that they make each location unique to its area code including the menus . SERVICEIf service was amazing this place would definitely be a 5 5 in my book . It can get very unorganized and since the employees are dressed casually it sometimes difficult to tell who is who . In addition some of them are not the friendliest people and I sometimes feel like I m burdening them when I keep having to get their attention . However some servers are super friendly and go above and beyond . It really is hit or miss here . One cool thing is that you can get samples of any of the drinks ! They bring you a little shot glass of beer to try things out . FOOD & DRINKTwo words : CUTTING . BOARD . I do not know why I m so obsessed with it but the Cutting Board ($14 appetizer charcuterie plate) is just bomb to me ! It a combination of the delicious cured meats cheese and thin crispy bread . They meld together so well ! Also love the onion and capers . It so worth . Also the AHI TUNA TACOS are amazing . I have never liked those kind of newfangled tacos (I will stick to my adobada and tripa thank you) but this one had the perfect amount of freshness delicate fish and thin crisp . It just melts in your mouth ! $10 gets you 4 tacos . I had a couple other dishes but none of them really made an impression . As for drinks I have only tried a few of the craft beers on their menu . Campfire Stout is alright but I was happy to see they carried Ninkasi Dawn of the Red . The bill can get a little costly here (depending on your appetite for food and alcohol) but sometimes it worth the splurge especially if you get to sit on the balcony on a nice evening . I have yet to hit up their happy hour but will definitely come back soon ! ',\n",
       " 'Gold Dust WomanDamn I really hate being THAT guy . You know the last on one the bandwagon . . . before everyone else has already jumped off because it going down in flames . Well because of Lil Brown Sugar Cupcakes I officially jumped on board (feel free to exit the cabin at any time) . Over the past 3 weeks I have sampled probably a dozen flavors and all of them were absolutely spot on . First of all if you have read any of my reviews of cupcake places (if not I will find you and tape your eyelids open) I do not like frosting . Yeah I m odd like that but my kids love that they get an extra dose of kiddy crack . These are the only cupcakes where I absolutely cannot pass up the frosting . They capture the essence of the flavor in the frosting like how Jelly Belly does in a jelly bean . Seriously ! Here a rundown :1 . Key Lime - Hold your butt cheeks together otherwise you will shit yourself . The frosting tastes like a fluffy key lime pie . Well not \"like\" a key lime pie . . . EXACTLY like one . I actually ate the frosting before the cupcake . It so light and fluffy it feels like there are not any calories just angel dust . The cupcake itself had a hint of lime which was nice but really it was second fiddle to the frosting . 2 . Butter Beer - I think this was butterscotch cake batter mixed with cream soda topped with butterscotch frosting . I m not a fan of butterscotch but the flavors were so rich and flavorful . The cake was a little too dense for my wife taste but exactly how I like it . 3 . Peanut Butter Cup - It was a chocolate cupcake with a Hershey Kiss baked inside topped with peanut butter frosting . I hate peanut butter so this was not my cup of tea because it tasted exactly like a peanut butter cup (duh) . On the other hand my wife and mother - in - law thought this was their favorite of all . 4 . Strawberry Lemonade - One of my favorites . The cupcake is a strong lemon flavor . Not tart and not sweet . Just easily identifiable as lemon . The frosting was on the sweeter side so I did scrape off about half but it perfectly complemented the cupcake to the point where it really did taste like a mild strawberry lemonade . 5 . Orange Dreamsicle - Just like when Ego eats the ratatouille my hanabata days memories of eating a Meadow Gold orange dreamsicle came rushing back . This cupcake was like eating a fluffy one and without the brain freeze . Of all the flavors I have tried this is the most subdued yet highly addictive . 6 . Chocolate Covered Strawberry - Exactly as described a chocolate cupcake with strawberry frosting . Not quite the most memorable but not too shabby either . The fact that the frosting is mixed with FRESH strawberries gets points from me . 7 . S mores - Dude . Totally tastes like a s more . And nowhere near as sweet as a real one . Chocolate (maybe it was Devil Food) cupcake with marshmallow whip frosting topped with crushed graham cracker . My family still raves about this one . 8 . Thin Mint Cake Pop - When the lady behind the counter told me it tastes like a Thin Mint she was not kidding . Sans the snap of the cookie this thing is choco - minty goodness . Get two of these and you almost have a box of the real thing . 9 . Sugar Cookies - I buy these for my rug rats . Have not been able to taste them because they are usually gone . I guess that means they are pretty good . 10 . Red Velvet - Tastes like red velvet . Although it is exactly as described I would have to say this is the most boring flavor offered (this statement comes from a guy who LOVES red velvet . I m the guy who bought my wife a red velvet birthday cake because hell if I like it she better like it too (right?)) . I suggest you do yourself a favor and try anything else in the case . I would argue that these tasty nuggets do not contain brown sugar . No they must have been sprinkled with some gold dust because I m ready to dig in with my silver spoon . ',\n",

The Cambodian Rambo was there behind the counter and we greeted him like a long lost friend ; after all we had the advantage of knowing his life story from the article . The shop is decorated with pictures of Mr . Seang with local law enforcement his biggest fans and rightly so with his donuts and patriotism winning them over years ago . A friendly and humble man we congratulated him on the feature article and he asked us how to find the story on his smartphone since he was still trying to figure out how to use it . In exchange he served up some of his delicious donuts . I went with my usual crumb and coconut cake donuts while the b f had a blueberry donut and a French cruller . I sampled his blueberry donut which was still warm and if that was not the best blueberry donut ever ! I do not normally have that flavor but Donut Hut version has won my heart or stomach . Actually I would have to say both . It difficult to come away from meeting the man behind the donuts knowing how he survived the horrors of Pol Pot regime fought in the resistance lived in a refugee camp made his way to Las Vegas and ultimately took ownership of this little donut shop and not feel like his donuts are something special . It just my opinion but I will gladly return here to buy more donuts from a man like this and support his business with pleasure as I try to do with other local donut shops similarly run by Asian immigrants such as Mr . Seang who probably have fascinating stories to tell as well . The donuts are great but Mr . Seang is amazing . I would encourage anyone who likes donuts to stop by and give Donut Hut a try and meet its fabulous owner . PS : Both the crumb donut and coconut cake donut were delicious as well . *CASH ONLY*',\n",

It was time for a break and I walked into the break room and there it was . . . pizza from Angelina . My boyfriend knew I was not having a good night so he decided to surprise me with comfort food .

For $35 you get unlimited made - to - order tapas . It really a great deal ! First off though finding Border Grill was a bit of a pain . It really deep within the resort basically near the pool area . If you are coming in from the monorail basically keep walking past the casino and through restaurant row . You will know you are on the right path if you pass Aureole and then eventually you will see signs pointing to Border Grill . It was a beautiful day outside so I decided to so sit at their Patio . Even though I had a reservation I opted to sit at the bar since the table they provided me had too much sun shining down on it . But let get on to the Border Brunch . They provide you with a menu of about 22 dishes to order and you basically order anything you want . For a solo diner they recommend ordering two at a time and four to five dishes at a time if you are with a group .

This oyster taco is really about the size of a street taco so it was only a few bites but that was more than enough for me . I really enjoyed it ! Churro Tots - - http : bit . ly 1GxS79ZDulce de leche infused churros cinnamon sugar chocolate ganache passion fruit pureeFrom the beginning I already planned on ordering this last since it pretty much like a dessert . As small as these tots were they were pretty dense but had good flavor . The two sauces worked well with them . Overall I thought the $35 AYCE tapas Border Brunch was worth it . But I was really limited to my stomach capacity since I only got try 6 dishes out of the 22 . I highly recommend coming with a group if you plan to try all 22 dishes . As for Border Grill it a really nice restaurant ! It a nice take on upscale Tex - Mex food similar to Mesa Grill . I did visit the other location at the Forum Shops which I will review later but I like this location a lot better especially if you can snag a table outside . I would definitely love to come back again to them for dinner . ',\n",

For the best frozen treat ever you can walk across the street to Sweet Republic . When you compare Mix n Lix looks kind of sad and pathetic . I popped in after a sandwich session at Quizno and I was disappointed . The woman working at the counter did not really know much about the product but to her credit she was friendly and did not cop an attitude . The store itself is small and I was let down by the lack of flavor options . The topping bar is a bit bizarre . It split up on two sides of the store . It just made everything . . . uncomfortable . Lastly I was a little creeped out by the Disney Channel videos on the TV . There were no kids in here nor were there any kids working here . You are better off going elsewhere . Go to Golden Spoon . Who cares if you cannot swirl it yourself? At least the product and store is better . ',\n",
       " 'Definitely an awesome hotel . I love stealing stuff from hotels . Once I stole two terrycloth bath robes from a room at the Venetian . What worse is that I was with my mom . She stole one too . Then we started to get paranoid that maybe they would notice they were gone from the room . So we went out to the housekeeper cart and took three robes off the cart and put them in the room . Then we started to get paranoid that they had hidden cameras in the hallway and were going to add the price of the robes to our room bill . So we figured out a way to smuggle the stolen ones out without being seen . You will get a lot more value for your money if you can manage to swipe two or three robes and enough towels to make a complete bath set . The gold accent bands on the towels complement my bathroom very nicely . oh I liked how the room had a terraced layout stepping down to the lounge . ',\n",
       " 'Giving ANY Postino a two star pains me . . . but my experience here last weekend is exactly what happened to me : Pain . I have waited for SO long for Postino to come to Kierland and this location is superb ! My bestie and I had opted out of a LBD night and just went on an impromptu hike and did not want to completely miss out on Postino goodness . . . We are frequents to Postino Arcadia IN FACT its one of my favorite GO TO and one of the places I recommend to anyone that asks me for a great date place or where to grab the best bruschetta and wine ! With that we braved Postino on a Saturday evening as the desert sun was setting in all of our sweaty goodness blonde hair up and sunglasses on and just decided to dodge into this new Postino and grab quick bruschetta take out a maybe a quick glass of wine while we waited and dodge out before anyone may judge us on our less than attractiveness and we caused too much a stir or took too much space up . Already about 600pm on this particular Saturday evening this new Postino was packed with Scottsdales usual bevy of beautiful people ! The atmosphere was lively and upbeat ! I particularly loved the open - ness of this new location ! The bar opens out to a patio that is larger than any of the other Postino locations and looks out into Kierland Commons for good people watching . Now I had wished we had taken the time post hike and gone back home and showered and pulled our blonde selves together for a Postinos night out because the vibe was fun trendy and as Postino always is : On point . Nonetheless we were shuffled to the bar by the hostess to place our to - go order with the bartender ; She was not overly friendly but I understand this location has just newly opened and they were also quite slammed ; literally there was not one seat open inside or out at the bar . My bestie and I are literally about 5 1 and 5 2 inches tall and weigh NOT much and we asked one server who seemed pretty annoyed with us standing at the bar waiting where we should stand . . he pointed to us to go stand by the door and said \"Well your kind of in the way here\" . We apologized to him but honestly did not know where to go ! There was no space at the bar no space at any of the high tops no space by the door . We just stood behind each other and opted to not have that glass of wine we had wanted to have while awaiting our take out order . About twenty minutes later we noticed two take out bags come out to the bar a girl from behind the bar asked the bartender who took our order something about the bags and they were suddenly moved over to the side . We figured between the server and the bartender they wanted us out of their way as soon as possible so the brown take out bags could not be ours ! We waited a few more minutes and saw another brown bag come out and the same scenario take place . . ten more minutes go by and the server continued to become more annoyed with our standing beside where he was coming and going from the bar . Finally we asked about the bag and take out . A female server asked our name and low and behold grabs the first bag that had been sitting there for almost thirty minutes ! NO apology . Feeling in the way and sorry we ever had this idea in the first place we left with our take out . Note to self call ahead for take out and send one person in and ask the hostess to retrieve it . We get home now with our own wine get our lovely Postino bruschetta out and the Sunshine Dream Salad which is one of my very favorite salads . Ta Dah ! A few bites in to the salad however I knew something was very wrong . I am allergic to several nuts . NOT the cashews that are usually in this salad but almost every other kind of nut . My mouth was swelling my face was turning red and I know the signs of what was about to happen . Clearly a nut besides cashew was substituted in my salad ; This just became my Saturday night : dealing with heading off a food allergy before I ended up in the hospital . I LOVE Postino ! I have had ROTD more than a couple of times in the past few years for how much I love them ! As someone with food allergies I scan a menu back and forth to make sure to take the responsibility of NOT ordering anything remotely near what can make me sick . IF there is a doubt I discuss with the server . IT a complete pain to do that at times ! I think this Postino location is still great and I think GREAT potential is there once they get though working the kinks out . The other locations are awesome and with this Kierland location and how trendy the great indoor outdoor bar and patio area and size of this location there is NO way it wo not be amazing ! A little work on customer service is in order and watching food cross contamination or substitution of ingredient ? or order mix ups? if that is what happened in my case with this salad is hugely important ! Will I be back? Absolutely ! I hope the kinks get worked out fast as the vibe and menu have made me love Upward Projects and other Postinos locations . ',\n",
       " 'Surprisingly tasteless . It was as if they did not add salt to anything . The dough had wood fired marks but no wood fired taste . It also just did not taste . There was no sense of yeast . The mushrooms and pepperoni also were bland . I was very disappointed . ',\n",

I always get a 2x1 (two patties with one cheese) animal style with raw onions instead of grilled . It never fails that the cashier always looks at me with a confused expression . When I explain myself he or she ALWAYS says \"so you want a double double . \" No I do not want 2 pieces of cheese ! That why I ordered a 2x1 . How is it that I know how to order it and I do not even work there? Despite this small snafu everything else is peachy ! I will continue to dine at this location whenever I m in the area . ',\n",

The rooms are big (big enough for 12 girls ! ) some have 2 beds + 1 pull out couch two sinks and lots of mirrors (to get ready for clubbing) .

The rooms are nice looking clean and the idea of hugging the toilet does not make you sick to your stomach . That code for I love this place . Warning : The see through shower makes it a little hard to get ready in the bathroom while someone is showering . Also do not try to walk from XS back to the Venetian . In your 5 inch heels .

       " 'Sometimes even I take a good place for granted - guilty . You all know what I mean . You visit regularly you eat their food drink their booze and then do not call or visit for awhile . It sort of like that \"person\" you call when you are not dating anyone or are between relationships not for anything physical but just for the comfort of not being alone . It a sad trait and when it happens to a place like King Henry in Richmond Hill I feel extra bad because they are often overlooked but are doing so many amazing things in this Richmond Hill staple that they deserve our patronage . Like did you know that King Henry has one of THE best rotating selections of Craft Beers on tap here? True story . I would challenge you to find a spot in the Hill that has had more OCB on draft then KHA . Heck they even signed up to have the extremely limited edition Yelp beer on tap when Great Lakes developed it in November of 2014 . But is the beer enough to make you venture to this plaza at the corner of 16th and Yonge? Probably not unless you are a Hop - Head purist . So here another reason their food is bloody fantastic . From simple pub foods like wings which are massive to their unique offerings like pot pies (kidnet steak chicken etc) without the pie portion (more of a stew with pie crust laid on top) KHA has the eats that make your tummy feel good ! Now I have read some reviews mentioning that the space is touch dated and while that may be true it only a matter of time before it gets a facelift but that is not important to me . What I love about this place is all that I have mentioned before plus the awesome staff and quirky regulars . The regulars are an awesome bunch whom you can find seated around the bar at all hours talking sports and even some nonsense sipping on domestic ales for hours at a time . I have sat amongst them and while they bare the prickly exterior of the a - typical regular their the nicest gang and welcome most folks into their conversation (provided you have got something of merit to add in) . Since the closing of Canadian Tire and Futureshop in the area you might not have the added drive to venture into the plaza but if you are considering the McDonalds next door simply part your car and come in you will be much happier with your choice the food and heck the prices are not too bad either . I dig this place and all that it is ! Eatcrest Out',\n",
       " 'My husband and I are on the cusp of having lived in Las Vegas for 4 years . We moved here from LA near the 10 and 110 . Basically we know our tacos . We have had good tacos in Las Vegas but none ever compared to the street tacos from a stand or truck somewhere near an LA freeway . This all said I took my husband here for lunch about a month ago after months of insisting it was worthy of his consideration . He gone back several times since declaring their tacos the best in Las Vegas . I have been along for a few . The carne asada taco is available for $ . 99 ea on Wednesdays . All of the meats are well prepared . The pastor is sweet and charred . The barbacoa is moist and tender . The chorizo is flavorful and just the right amount of sweet . The asada is beefy and crisp . The lengua is tasty . Carnitas will be added to the \"one of each\" taco order . The salsas are literal and figurative FIRE . If you like your nose to run while eating (which I do) load up on the salsas . The interior consists of 3 - 4 four - tops a counter for ordering one large trash can and a large flat - screen TV above the salsa bar . The storefront is next to a gas station . It not a place for a large party sit down . In fact most guests order the food to go . ',\n",

Maybe 6 rooms in the entire hotel have a decent connection most wo not even let you check email)* air conditioning (our group had 3 rooms with no air conditioning the entire week and no one ever came to fix it ! ) * breakfast that does not come out of a plastic wrapperWhen you are trying to so Vegas on the cheap look for deals anywhere but here .

If it your first date take her here because she will appreciate your style and if you are looking for a special spot with someone you have known for a long time she will love it & it should guarantee a fun evening . It all white with black & silver touches and yes it trendy but bottom line the food is great & the service is usually perfect . It the perfect balance between feminine & masculine touches . I have been here many times & the only complaint I have is that sometimes the service can lack (when there large parties) . This has happened to us several times . What great about the service here is that usually the waiter knows things are backed up & that when a complimentary starter or dessert will pop up . It always appreciated . Let get to the food . I have tried nearly everything & I love it especially my mans NY strip that comes with crispy potatoes (crispy perfection) and balsamic reduction drizzled over everything . Hands down one of the best items on the menu . The portion is massive so ladies just have a few bites from your partner . I typically order the scallops which always change a little depending on what is in season (it always delicious) . And we never skip starting with the cheese . They have a wide selection and it always comes with a side of jam (this one happened to be apple cinnamon) amazing ! Do not skip the cheese . . . There also a beautiful outdoor space that you should take advantage of when the evening weather is nice . It feels like you are in another world and its the perfect sunset dining moment . If you have not been here yet it an absolute must . Make a reservation because evenings are always busy here . ',\n",

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood . After all they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye . What I was hoping for was a 1 - 1 - 1 2 thick steak cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered . What I got a a 3 4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat gristle and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style . Salad similar to something you could get at Chick FiletVeggies blah . Bread basket ample but day old and if not it certainly was not fresh . In addition to bad food we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables listening to conversations ranging from someone recent bout with pinkeye and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French until the waiter showed up then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English . I have had it with this place . If I m going to pay 150 bucks for dinner it will be at Mortons or Maestro where the steaks are 1 - 1 2 in thick cooked to perfection and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle',\n",

They are open almost 24 7 (okay 6am is pretty 24 7 to me ! ) and they are located in the MGM which is just a sprawling mass of activities and food alike . I have gotten various things there from steak to sandwiches to fries . Nothing was amazingly standout but nothing was terrible or bad or even average . Everything was pretty good and the service was amazing even at 3am . I would highly recommend this but only if you are staying in MGM . I definitely would not uber or taxi here in the middle of the night it not worth the drive ! ',\n",

Where it fails absolutely is that it turned into a very young 21 - ish hipster dump with people screaming like girls lots of drunken antics (guys throwing other guys over their shoulders a little sickness on the side) and a staff that has no idea how to control this unwieldy beast . Let me address first the bar situation . Sadly understaffed . Will the unkempt bartender whose ass crack I saw more than I cared to was rude inefficient dirty looking (I mean scuzzy) and completely biased toward those he served . If they do not fire this guy then he obviously in with the bosses . Loser . A girl with a tramp stamp (you cannot miss it it takes up her whole back) behind the bar with her face in the computer for a good solid 20 minutes (that how long it took us to get a drink and I STILL do not know what she looks like) ignoring everyone at the bar that she works at for a living to do nothing . Perfect . Well that about it for bartenders on a loud busy Thursday night . A bar back that we would asked to help us get oblivious tramp stamp girl attention snapped at us like we were filthy animals who would wandered in for a scrap . Maybe a little customer service training is in order . I THINK SO . On our way outside to the back through the blasting music that was so loud that if you could hear yourself think you would tell yourself to leave saw a guy passed clean out . A sonic boom could not wake this guy . Because that how loud the music was and he was snoring heavily . Finally make it out to see a bunch of seriously young looking kids screaming about Jenga . The fabulous band (with a bass player ! ) could not be heard over the juvenile squeals and blocks crashing of this game that seems fun but not when you have cool music to listen to . Priorities are not right here . We had one great bartender who came over and got us our second drink . She was sweet and very cool . I tried to hand her a tip but she had walked away (??) . I had to call her back . Pretty sure she not used to that with this entitled whiny crowd . Ugh . I would die if I had her job . Or I would probably go to jail for back handing some of those kids . Where were their parents??Anyway avoid until this situation fixes itself it has so much potential . As of now it just a joke . As an aside I would say to the manangers : if you want to make money it not by alienating people who have disposable income to spend and allowing the college level brats who make minimum wage to take over . I m pretty sure they are costing you as much as you are making both in keeping the older crowd away and with the serious destruction they looked like they were causing . ',\n",
       " 'I am really surprised to see that there are only a few not - so - great reviews yet so many 4 and 5 star reviews . Based on my one experience I m going to go easy on the place because I will give them a second chance . Last week at work I decided to order out . Two of the ladies at work said that Aiello was awesome and that if I was going to call in an order they would like a grilled chicken salad . They agreed that one salad was big enough for the two of them to share and honestly I could probably share too . I said their salads cannot be that big but they insisted . I did not want a salad so I went with half a steak hoagie . When I called a man answered who I later discovered was the owner . This was how our conversation went :Aiello . . . Hi I would like to place an order to pick up . Go ahead . I would like a grilled chicken salad . What else?Half a steak hoagie . What else?And so on . . . . I was taken back with how rude this dude was . So I m given money for the chicken salad and since I was told the food would be ready in 15 minutes I headed out . I go in and am surprised to see that they only accept cash . Luckily I always carry cash on me . The girl who rang me out was friendly and had no problem ringing up the orders separately . The owner comes over with my to go order and I ask if he the one who answered the phone . He says yes and asks why . I say no reason . But truthfully I wanted to see if it was in fact the owner that was so rude to me on the phone . He goes on to tell me that they are known for their hoagies and the buns are toasted like really toasted . It their signature thing he tells me . Okay anyone can toast a bun I think . Anyways I take the order back to work and pull out the food . I have to admit that even for a to go order the chicken salad was absolutely huge and could probably feed two maybe three people . I did not try any but it looked really good and had tons of toppings . Problem is it $11 . 25 . So what if it just you ordering or eating? Who wants to pay that much for a salad if you cannot split it? Also . . . they only give you one tiny container of dressing for that big salad . Extra dressing is $ . 75 . My steak hoagie was indeed really toasted . Too much in fact . Also the sauce that the steak was mixed in was also tossed in with the lettuce tomato and onions making everything \"wet\" and kind of soggy . Soggy inside burnt outside . Some pros : The place was clean and inviting . This area definitely needed a nice little restaurant and it situated off of the main road (route 130) . Also the waitress cashier was friendly . Lastly I have heard that there pizza is very good so I will give this place another try but I m not in any hurry . ',\n",

I sipped it all the way to the subway platform . I realized there was no yogurt in the drink and returned to the Timmy . I told them it was not made properly and I felt a large amount of sass from the lady who made it . But what was she even upset about? Making me wait so long for a poorly made beverage that I paid $4 for??? Lady U can keep your sass to yourself . I will keep my twoonies .

The Corndog Company LV makes its way all around town . I have been going to the Food Truck Party near Total Wine on Centennial Center and when I noticed on social media that this truck would be there I had to stop by . They had a long line and you need to be prepared to wait 5 - 10 minutes after ordering because each corndog is hand - dipped to order and fried to perfection . The corndogs come in a couple sizes and range in price from $4 - $6 . Not every time but sometimes the truck does have fried cheese sticks and you will want to try these if they have them when you visit . The fried cheese sticks have the same delicious crispy batter as the regular corndogs but are filled with either pepper jack or american cheeses . The corndogs themselves are really tasty . I always order mine with honey and suggest you do also . The honey is drizzled on after the corndog comes out of the fryer . I also add ketchup and mustard that usually in coolers right outside the truck and you can add as much as you want . The people working the truck are very friendly . This truck is worth checking out and you can see their schedule on social media and sometimes they have daily specials posted there also . ',\n",

The drive down out west from Brampton was not bad at all and we found parking conveniently infront of this restaurant bar . I walked in with my friend and the place was dimly lit music was not too loud and this place was totally live . The atmosphere can work for a date night or a friends get together . We were seated along with our friends and the server Sarah was so friendly and thoroughly explained the dinner specials . Earlier in the day I had a huge double angus burger so I had no room for dinner but still needed to eat something ( hate that feeling) . After I browsed through the menu I decided to order some apps . I ordered the angus short rib sliders and the calamari . The server was really attentive and brought out all of our food at once . Now let me tell you about these 3 moist flavourful soaked in BBQ sauciness sliders . . Ahhh so good ! I was thinking to order another round but then I thought to myself \"you ding bat you could have ordered an entree\" . Anyway sad to say the calamari was not too good . It was so salty and I actually started to get a headache from how overly salty it was ! I got the servers attention and told her about the calamari and she was more than happy to get us something else . I took a good look at the menu again and decided to try the Mediterranean dip platter . After waiting about 10 minutes she came out with med platter and I digged right in . The platter had pita and tortilla chips with these three incredible dips ; hummus sundried tomato feta dip and calamata tapenade . It was so delicious that I ended up getting more chips because there was so much dip left . Now I m awfully curious to try everything else on the menu . I will definitely be back for the dip and sliders . . Yum ! ! ',\n",

This spot has been on my Bookmark list for dayyyyssssss but just never got the chance to hit it up until last Saturday ! First of all I totally judged this book by its cover (with nooooointention to do so) it just that it located in a secluded shopping center that does not seem like it would have a restaurant centrally located but once you are inside the restaurant it super cute clean and cozy with about 12 tables inside . We were pleasantly greeted with smiling faces and were seated right away . The menu? ! Wow the menu is surprisingly plentiful with many choices from traditional Asian fusion new specialties and much much more ; needless to say the options are endless ! Because I wanted one of everything we trusted our server Cassandra who provided us with great recommendations . . . For drinks my husband opted for the Watermelon Lemonade (yep you read that loud and clear ; water - melon - lemon - ade ! ) but made it a mimosa so she added champs to it . This was theeeee best mimosa I have ever had so f cking refreshing and light ; super easy to drink ! For an appe to share we ordered the *Heirloom Vegetable Lumpia . Oh my these babies were a great twist from the original lumpias I m used to from family parties . These Lumpia consist of strictly fresh veggies filled with zucchini corn tomatoes onions and more ! The real surprise was the dipping sauce that had this ginger garlic soy sauce Thai pepper kick which brought in all flavors from each Lumpia bite . This dish surprised me with all its flavors ! Order this is delicious . For foods we opted to SHARE the Barbacoa Burger in 12 oz and added avocado to the side . Please please peep my photo although it does not do justice - this buyer is HUGE - so big that my husband and I shared a half between the both us and we were full . The beef patty is da real VIP here ! The patty is a mix of beef brisket rib eye prime rib - you name it all the best pieces of beef grounded in a delicious patty ! Atop that patty you have juicy Barbacoa spread on top like it jelly OMG SO gooooood ! Yes this burger will cost you a whopping $25 but trust me it so worth it ! This review is not 5 Stars for nothin ! I also loved how the head chef came out to great ya and make sure we were happy with the foods . I cannot wait to go back for my seconds thirds fourths . . . you get the idea ! Come by and get SERVED ! ',\n",

Let me break it down list style . 1 . Menu is limited . Think In - N - Style . You select an item and it comes with : unlimited red white wine soup or salad garlic bread and a dessert cappuccino (aka a hot chocolate) . $24 . 95 - $49 . 95 per person based on meal option . 2 . Since a friend and I arrived an hour early we waited at the bar I ordered a diet coke and she a beer and two apps : fried mozzarella & fried zucchini . Total : $34 The fried cheese and zucchini were not anything special and we are $9 . 95 a piece and we are just average . 3 . Once our full party arrived I learned I could not transfer my diet coke to the table which was annoying . Our orders placed soup salad garlic bread and wine came to the table quickly . 4 . Since it was late (9 :45 PM & they close at 10 :30 PM) our table was seated in the only room with other patrons . It was packed and loud and we all felt squishy . 5 . My friend and her sister split the Veal Marsala ($31 . 95) . It cost them an extra $13 for splitting a plate (because you get those included extras) The veal was overcooked and rubbery . I ordered the Steak Pizzaiola which is basically a large piece of meat with marinara served with a side of garlic cream spinach . The steak was the blandest least flavorful slab of meat ever . The tomato sauce (calling it marinara would be a grave misjustice to Italians everywhere) was also lackluster . Price point for this disaster $28 . 95 . These two entrees came with a side of ziti and more of that tomato sauce . 6 . Lastly the check came and so did the post meal cappuccino which tasted like a hot chocolate . This stuff was delicious . Rich chocolatey and creamy . Nothing reminiscent of a cappuccino not a hint of frothy milk . The service was weak the food was tasteless and prices were gauged . Do not eat here . You will be full but you will feel like you were just ripped off . Butt - istas Hole in the Wall is what it shall be named henceforth . ',\n",
       " 'Amazing dessert place for all ages . Chef Desyree has the best skills to blend most unique flavors into the tastiest gelatos . Some of the most unique flavor that I tried include avocado mac & cheese and chocolate with dry red pepper . But my favorite is pistachio its creamy and has the right amount of nuttiness ( i think i invented a word there) . Its not extremely sweet either . Art of Flavors also serves freshly baked cookies . They are also very good if you are a bit of a sweet - tooth than I would recommend cookie - gelato sandwich . Overall (5 5) it does not matter if you are in the area or you making a trip to eat here . This is a must try place for ice - cream gelato lovers . ',\n",

Saturday they had a live Hawaiian band playing in the outside area and it was really nice I actually enjoyed it a lot . But of course it was pack with stupid drunks everywhere . Literally got stepped on by three people by that time I was ready to go . This place is not what it used to be anymore . Thanks people for ruining it . . . k bye',\n",

       " 'I was on this side of town for a meeting and this was the closest coffee spot . I was in the mood for a latte so I thought I would give this other Mad House location a chance . The venue itself is pretty cute . Small and filled with tables high and low . The outside has padded wicker furniture inviting you to sip some espresso while reading a good book . The gentlemen behind the bar were busy cranking out drinks for their drive thru customers but did stop to greet me and take my order a small almond milk latte . I planned on enjoying the coffee in house but the employee walked the drink out to me in a to - go cup . The cup was 1 4 foam which was super bubbly and also fell about 1 2 inch below the rim of the cup . It also tasted like raspberry syrup . Maybe they did not rinse the pitcher while steaming the milk? Not sure . They were kind enough to remake my drink but it came back to me with the same result . Mad House is not cheap and for the price I expect a higher quality of drink . The venue is totally welcoming and somewhere I could see myself hanging out but I came for the coffee . Fingers crossed for a better experience if I make my way back . ',\n",
       " 'The first rule of pie making must be to have perfected crust . It should be flaky delicate sweet and tempt you to eat the entire perimeter [to really piss off your family] . Whatever the dry flavorless stuff was that held this thing together might as well have been cardboard . I got an apple pie which should be the benchmark . if you cannot make an amazing apple pie you should go into the cupcake business . The apples were wafer thin and under - cooked the spice was too strong too much allspice or clove over - powering . Seasoning should be subtle and delicate with nice chunks of soft baked apples simmering a a delicious almost caramelized sauce . . . . something to really blend in with Ice Cream if you go a la mode . The most telling sign has to be this . My two kids ate two bites and left theirs untouched on the counter and a day later I have half the pie left . Even the crappiest $5 pie from Fry I pick at until it long gone within 2 - 4 hours tops . Today I brought the leftover to office those vultures will eat packets of taco bell hot sauce . Maybe my palate is not sophisticated enough to appreciate a $20 artisan pie . My palate does not give two shits about anything but taste and texture period . I cannot will myself to hanker for this . Now my quest for a decent apple pie that I don ;t have to bake myself continues . Thanks Pie Hole for reminding me my Grandma is dead and I cannot go home again . ',\n",

Went here after dinner on 2 1 14 with Beau S . for two reasons - 1# I noticed Chris R . mentioning or checking in to this place a bunch on Yelp & 2# I saw the article in the Weekly about their ice cream sandwich and figured it would be something Beau would be into . We sampled a few of the flavors and I agree with another reviewer about the milky flavors . I settled on the small spicy chocolate and Beau got the medium guava sorbet and it came out to a bit over $8 . They were not making the sandwiches at the time but maybe I was seeing things when I thought I saw a sign saying ice cream sandwiches were in the $6 + range . Yikes ! I commented to Beau that I wished they had an even smaller size available . While I did not try it I could not imagine trying 3 + oz of the smoked salmon gelato . My spicy chocolate was good but even 3 oz felt like a lot to me . The dessert was good but I would have to start craving this place for me to up the stars . ',\n",

       " 'This water show in front of the Bellagio has become one of the quintessential things to do while you are in Las Vegas . It is absolutely free and is not something you should miss . The 100 + water jets are synchronized to classic Las Vegas show tunes and Frank Sinatra songs . At night the songs and water also include different colored lights which can be really dazzling . While this show can look really neat when you are driving by on the Strip it is really something that you should take the time to see in person on the sidewalk . During the weekend and busy times they run a show every15 minutes to half hour . So if you have the time it is worthwhile to watch one or two shows because there are many different ones that play throughout the day and night . The area has also become popular with sidewalk musicians performers and other characters you can take pictures with . So there is more entertainment than just the show . I would totally recommend making it one of your stops while you were in Las Vegas . ',\n",
       " 'Very few restaurants cause me to drop dietary defenses but I must admit Couscous Express had me forgetting about my food concerns . This little restaurant on E McDowell is good for lunch and an early din - din . It lives up to the express in its name . The owner did not have us sitting for long with an empty spot on the table . We wanted to try everything so more or less ordered the whole farm . Meat fish poultry herbs and veggies grains roots legumes fruit dairy . It was like a continuous parade of platters were being marched to our table and the owner accommodated us with extra plates to serve the food . All dishes are suitable for one person but if you do not come with a big appetite two people can share a plate and still get full . I managed to finish ev ry bite with no leftovers . Hercules ! Hercules ! Hercules ! The nitty - gritty on the dishes : - Date shake . How do you say YUM? I could wake up and drink that stuff for breakfast . It was thick peanut - y and not too sweet . Bet I could work through the entire morning on one date shake . Protein shake? We do not need no stinkin protein shakes . We gots date shakes B - otch . - Tea was okay . Maybe if it was served after the meal and a hotter temperature I would have enjoyed it more . - Hummus was deliciously flavourful . I could eat a tub of it . - Bread was a round of light fluffy flour that I prefer much more than pita . - Couscous side was absolutely delicious by itself . Whatever seasoning he used to give that salty cheesy flavor was a surprise to the taste buds . And the texture was perfect . I took some to go and ate it by itself in front of the telly . Instead of handfuls of buttered popcorn I had my spoonfuls of cheesy steamed couscous . What? ! Do not think I will ever ask for another pot of boiled couscous . Steamed only going forward . - Couscous salad . Mmmm - meh . Call me boring but I prefer green salads . Gotta get greens . - Lamb couscous was tender and cooked just right . - Tangines were delicous . Spiced right and flavourful not at all oily - obviously simmered in their own juices . - Bastilla . My first time having it . If I re - order it would have to be as a main dish with lots of side veggies . I like the top sweet crunchy phyllo but could do without the powdered sugar . Nitty - gritty on the decor :Simple and tasteful . Decorated with hookahs food stuffs and Argan oil for sale . Changes have been made since the earlier reviews this year . To get an idea of the new layout see the image that reviewer Franko L uploaded on May 11 2015 . There are about five small tables inside and one for a larger party . The center of the dining area is completely open so it has the appearance of plenty of space . Outside there are two large wooden tables . Separate restrooms for fe male is great for a such a small place but if you wish to avoid any claustrophobic winces and cramping I suggest you use the loo before getting to the restaurant and carry wet - naps to clean your hands before eating . Nitty - gritty on the owner :A genuine host . There were other customers dining as well and they were getting served just as fast as us . Obviously the owner knows what he doing . Definitely in his element with this petite - sized venue . He encouraged paced dining conversation and pure enjoyment of the meal . No customers were rushed into ordering or paying . Expectations :I wish there were more vegetables in the meals rather than so many potatoes . The few veggies I had were overcooked . After reading other yelp reviews and drooling over pictures of food I was looking forward to having the carrots and olives appetizers . Oh well next time . ',\n",

       " 'My husband Jim W . teases me because I only have one and five star reviews . I guess that what it takes to motivate me . Apparently I was really motivated this morning at McDonald . No one over the age of eight goes to McDonald for the food . We either go because it quick (sometimes) or cheap (not anymore) or convenient or because we are craving that childhood food memory . So Jim and I met there this morning (score one for convenient) for a quick snack and chat about the week . While we are waiting for the food I notice a sign that says they have free samples on Monday morning . I was fascinated by this . Since when has McDonald offered samples? And who has not tried their potatoes and needs to know what they taste like? Who does not know the taste of crunchy grease without a reminder? So curiosity getting the better of me I asked for a sample . I really wanted to see what it was . That when I was reminded where exactly I was . I was told that there was no way I could have a sample . When I inquired why that was I was informed that the person accompanying me had ordered what they were sampling . Oh . Though most yelpers know my prolific yelper husband this woman did not . In fact she had no idea who he was in relation to me . He could have been my husband but he could just as easily been an anal colleague who would rather die than allow me to sample his food which I assume was the implication in her refusal . Now I acknowledge that this is a ridiculous nothing of an issue . But these days I run into more and more silly little annoyances and I just could not let this one pass . You see the woman was very satisfied with herself as if I was trying to \"get over on the man\" (i . e . McDonald ) and she thwarted me . It just so stupid . So I guess they saved themselves a quarter of a hash brown but they got this nifty review instead . As to the biscuit I did eat well . . . it was McDonald . ',\n",

This is one of the main reasons I love being a Yelper yes we would love to rate places fairly to help people make choices but ultimately we are always looking to discover that one incredible gem of a place that knocks the socks off of what they do so we can tell the whole world all about it ! And of all my 100 plus reviews I have written so far this is my FIRST ONE ! You simply have to come here someday I do not care how just do it ! PLEASE NOTE - THEY ARE ONLY OPEN FOR LUNCH ! ! Their barbecue here is smoked to perfection using simple spices without any of those sauces ! Sure they have some incredible sauces on the side if you like to use them but I highly recommend against it ! Not with the flavor of these meats ! ! They offer brisket fatty brisket pulled pork pork ribs turkey and sausage ! You know what I did? You guessed it I ordered them ALL ! Best choice I ever made ! I had super high expectations after seeing their 5 - star rating with over 1300 reviews but even my expectations were surpassed ! I m not going to go on and on about the flavor all I will tell you is it the best and they do not smother it in sauces they smoke it just right using simple spices to bring out the meats own most delicious flavor ! Parking here is tight so I suggest coming before noon . Hopefully there will only be about 20 or 30 people in line at that point . If you are lucky . Nobody leaves the line everybody waits patiently to reach the meat slicer who cuts your meat in front of you . Then they give you sides and drinks . Not much seating a few tables inside some extra tables outside in the back underneath a roof . But let face it you are not here for a fancy restaurant are you?This is a \"must go to\" place go out of your way to go here if you need to ! Do not miss out ! My favorite Yelp discovery to date !

Maybe it the giant bowls they serve the salads in . They make me think of Pizza Hut after a softball game circa 1980 . Here are some things I like best about Maizie :The wingless buffalo dip is deadly - - I mean that in a good way (and it should be on the late night menu) . It gotta be mostly cream cheese . . . how can you go wrong? ! The fries are good but the potato cakes are frickin awesome ! Thick mounds of really yummy mashed potatoes with a hint of horseradish barely browned on either side .

In fact I think I will just stick with Lang Van curries when I m in the mood because as different as they are from Thai they are satisfying and complex and the chefs are willing to sub ingredients if you are having a craving for say eggplant instead of potato . This place is a vegetarian paradise and has three times as many options for meaters . My all time fav is the Banh Xeo - - a huge savory pancake made with shitakes and stuffed with bean sprouts and tofu . Served with that tangy peanut - y fish sauce and a mound of fresh herbs on the side as a salad - - thai basil mint cilantro and fresh lettuce . Talk about Vietflavor overload . LOVE it . ',\n",
       " 'I had high hopes for Bocho - downtown LV has long lacked a decent sushi joint . Unfortunately this spot still does not quite hit the spot . Fish is fresh but AYCE is the only reasonable way to go here . Lunch specials are pricey and do not highlight the fish items on the menu . On two separate lunch visits I opted for the Shunta Box - Bocho take on a bento box with a (heated) fish dish 4 piece California roll mixed tempura white rice and miso soup . I will say that I was pleasantly surprised by the small assortment of pickles included as an accent but even the half - roll I had was falling apart . I m not the hugest fan of heated salmon but two visits in a row they have been out of the black cod - other reviews mention this too . Maybe remove it from the menu and feature it as a special if it not consistently available or stock more if you legitimately run out all the time . It was a filling lunch but there are many places in town to get the same thing and it wo not run me $20 with tip . Service was fine . I sat at the sushi bar and placed my order directly with the chef hostess came around frequently to give drink refills . It nice to have this spot in the downtown area but they need to kick it up a notch - the special rolls sounded pretty standard and the bartender told another customer the carpaccio - type dishes did not qualify for AYCE pricing? Too many better places in town to come back here specifically . ',\n",
       " 'I do not think I have ever had another burrito that as tasty as Burrito Boyz . I have been coming here for years especially during the late night . I think throughout the years they have been perfecting the efficiency of their creation without making you seem like a fool and feeling rushed . The menu on the website and on the chalkboard in the resto is clear and you can figure out everything that you would want and be prepared before stepping up to the counter . But if you are not ready the friendly staff will guide you through it quickly and efficiently just like the rest of their operation . At lunch time it gets busy . It starts around 11 :30 and the place gets packed . It at least 15 mins wait . I would suggest calling in with your order and ask it to be ready at a certain time . Their website will clearly show you what you need to ask tell them about your order . You will step right up to the cash and they will give it to you and you can pay with cash debit or credit . It was so fast when I went to pick it up that I think I was in there for less than 2 minutes . The halibut I tired for the first time the other day and although good it was also a $2 more than the regular chicken steak version . But with so many fillings I barely tasted the halibut . Note to self : Spicy is quite spicy especially with jalapenosChicken Steak is $8 for a large including taxesHalibut is $10 for a small .

I lived right down the street from the Cafe Centraal location in Bay View and while the meal was always solid it was nothing special . However they do make a bloody good Bloody Mary and I was hankering for some booze on this particular evening ! After seeing Suffragette at the lovely Sundance theater my best gal pal and I headed over on a blistery Winters eve around 6 :45 . 30 min wait . Ah what? Okay . I m not the kind of gal who usually waits that long (I m usually always mad hangry and need to eat immediately) I decided to stick it out for the bloody mary . Atmosphere . One word . LOUD (as fuck) . I was yelling at my friend the whole evening went home hoarse . Bloody : Ordered the Godfather which is a Caprese Bloody . So darn good . Also 11 dollars . Literally cost more than me meal . Food : Eh average . Ordered a warm hummus plate which was described as warm hummus roasted veggies and pita . Did not realize the veggies were piled on top of the warm hummus as opposed to use for dipping . Was not practical but taste was decent ! Ordered a cone of frites and got fries . I m sure they are still working themselves out but frites are (from my humble understanding) supposed to be twice fried crispy lil things . These were big ol honking things with tons of potato . Delicious but not frites . To top off the average evening we were sat upstairs which has a glass window on top (I m assuming which can be moved for warm weather) Great idea but drafty as HECK on a 40 degree 25 mile an hour wind night . Also we were seated next to a LOVELY family with 5 children all of whom were running around like god dang monkeys while the parents ignored the children running into waitresses . Get your demon seed under control Madison ! Overall eh . Food is okay booze is great but the atmosphere made the evening far less enjoyable then it could have been . ',\n",

       " 'We saw this restaurant was popular and had good ratings on yelp so we made a brunch reservation during our stay in Vegas . The hours of operation and location were also very convenient and fit our schedule . Let get down to what we ordered . . . BAR MENU : all drinks came in these cute mason jars . Southern Peach - I got this because as I was reading the menu description it sounded like something I would like . It was a cocktail with lemon thyme peach and sweet tea . However do not know if it was the aperol or the whiskey . . . but the whole drink was too strong for me . I guess it due to the fact that I m not a heavy drinker at all . I could not really enjoy or finish it as much as I would have liked . Southern Revival - This one claimed to be a Yardbird favorite and was a mixture of whiskey passion fruit and basil . I took a sip and the taste was too potent for me . My taste buds could not handle the sweet and sourness of this one and my tablemate ended up ordering another drink in replacement since she did not really like it either . She ended up getting The Porkchop and liked that one much better and gave the Revival to our other tablemate . BRUNCH MENU : we ordered and split some appetizers and the main entrees . Deviled Eggs - Maybe it was my stomach that day but having cold eggs first thing in the morning did not sit well with me . The eggs were delicious however I was not a fan . Fried Green Tomato BLT - I enjoyed this a bit better than the eggs . The pork belly was crisp and the flavorings from the cheese tomatoes and vinaigrette complimented each other very well . Classic Buttermilk Biscuits - I do not really care for biscuits and everyone was saying we should not have ordered them because we ended up having too much food that we could not finish . The biscuits were alright nothing special . I did like the house - made jam that came with it though . Chicken n Watermelon n Waffles - definitely order this as a main entrée . I have never had anything like the chilled spiced watermelon that came with the chicken . It was SOOOO good . The waffles were different too but I wish I had tried the cheddar cheese waffle WITHOUT the syrup first cause once you mix them - the taste is very interesting . I did not hate it nor did I like it . All in all I liked this dish the most out of everything we ordered . Shrimp n Grits - I have never had grits before so this was a new experience for me . I would describe it as oatmeal - it was okay . I could not get over the texture and I kept thinking about it as I was chewing so that probably caused me to not particularly enjoy it . I did like the shrimp it came with they were delicious just no to the grits for me . I do not remember the name of our server but she was very friendly and nice . Upon knowing that it was my first time in Vegas she started suggesting all these things for me to do and see . It seemed like she really wanted to make my experience here as fun and as enjoyable as possible so I really appreciated that she went out of her way to do that . We had excellent service thanks to her and it made for a nice brunch and a great way to start off the day . ',\n",

The chips and salsa were good but not great . The rice and beans were blah . The vegetarian chalupa had a lot of guacamole on it topped off with lettuce and cheese .

With a daily happy hour til 8pm and a surprisingly affordable canned bottled beer selection avid uptown drinkers can most certainly pinpoint where Rott n Grapes draws its inspiration . The selection is top notch and with prices that will make your jaw drop . I scored a Koffee Kolsch one of my *favorite* beers for only 4 bucks ! There are plenty of other hard - to - find beverages . You WILL find something enjoyable . I love the atmosphere . Even if it a bit cramped inside the dim room + blue light + upbeat music makes me feel pretty gosh darn cool . There currently a canopy for extended seating with plans to add even more . The vision for this place is turning it into a groovy little lounge and even before that vision is realized I think my friends and I will most definitely become regulars here . I have no doubt stellar staff like Amy and Keith will have trouble impressing anyone ! Perhaps what is most impressive is that it only a couple months old AND it the staff first bar . Taking ideas from other revered local establishments and improving upon them has worked wonders and I look forward to Rott n thriving for years to come . ',\n",
       " 'So here is the deal with Chipotle . Every once in a while I forget why I do not like coming here and then *poof* . I magically find myself in line looking at that damned Aztec art thingy wondering what a plywood and sheet metal Montezuma has to do with the comically overstuffed burrito I am doomed to regret eating . The food does not taste horrible . It is decent . I really enjoy their fountain soda I do not know why . Their are a few places that just have amazing fountain soda . QT for one and Chipotle for two . (That reminds me I am going to yelp QT next . I have some shit to say about those Mo - Fo . )So here is why Chipotle gets two stars . Every time I eat there I get about halfway through my giant tube filled with meat beans and rice when Ol buzz kill Chipotle shows up in my gut like the cops coming to a party . Chipotle barges in and yells \"Chipotles here everybody OUT ! \" . That is when all of the drunken teenagers inside me make haste for the nearest exit . Yes I did just make a diarrhea euphemism relating Chipotle to the cops and my poop to drunken teenagers . I am not proud . Why do I repeatedly torture myself for mediocre food?Although I do expect mad props for not going with a Montezuma Revenge joke . ',\n",
       " 'I would be later coming home from a play Saturday afternoon and I decided to give Applebee a call and do a Carside to Go . I called and ordered a 2 for $20 . I ordered the mozzarella sticks for the appetizer and I got the Fiesta Lime chicken for my wife and I got the three cheese chicken penne for myself . They told me it would be twenty minutes . As it turned out traffic moved well along Charleston heading west and I was at Applebee in about 10 minutes . Rather than wait in the car I went in to let them know I was there and to pay . The young man working the carside said it would be ready soon and then went to pull the order in the computer . He could not find it and needed to get his manager . As this was happening Josh got the order ready but the manager still could not retrieve it . Rather than have me wait she told me she would find it later and I should just take the meals home and she wished me a Merry Christmas . I was taken back by her kindness . I brought the food home and we both enjoyed our dinners very much . The chicken is a dish my wife has gotten almost every time we have gone to an Applebee and it was a treat to have it again . The penne was very good . It had some red pepper that gave it a nice kick . The next day I was still upset by getting free meals so I went back to pay . The same manager came to talk to me and assure me it was OK the way things were . I made up for it by giving Josh a good tip to share with the servers and kitchen staff . Merry Christmas to them .

       " 'Lunch . Tuesday March 19 . 12 :30 PM . Upon arrival the parking lot was full as was the parking lot for the adjacent business . As I circled the full parking lot I passed someone tending a heavily smoking barbecue in the rear of the building - very promising . Barbecue smoke aroma is one of my favorite smells ! I followed two of North Carolina finest NCHP officers into the building . Hole in the wall is an apt description . I will bet the place does not seat 40 people . There were no seats available so we had to wait at the almost nonexistent foyer for the first available . One of the patrolmen said hello and in replying I mentioned that this was my first visit to Kyle Fletcher BBQ . He said that he eats here twice weekly and although the BBQ was \"good \" he said that he usually orders the hamburger . I thanked him and he and his partner were seated in less than two minutes . I waited and waited and waited and waited - probably twenty minutes for someone to get up so that I could be seated . There are only four chairs in the front entrance to wait and get out of everyone way . (By the way if you are a NC State basketball fan this place will make you crazy . A large portion of the walls and ceiling are dedicated to UNC basketball Dean Smith etc . I was raised watching Carolina basketball in the 60 when they were legitimately the best team in the United States most years so I actually liked the decor . )I noticed that the sanitation rating is 98 . 0 . I finally grabbed a booth and the waitress cleaned off the table for me PDQ . That was the highlight of the dining experience it was all down hill from there . I ordered the small sliced pork plate which is supposed to come with meat slaw fries hush puppies and baked beans . I opted out of the beans because I m allergic and I upgraded the fries to onion rings for an additional eighty cents . (I saw onion rings on several other tables and they looked good . ) I ordered lemonade for a change from sweet iced tea . For some reason the waitress had a hard time understanding that I did not want beans and this seemed to blow her mind . She came back almost immediately and asked if I wanted lemon in the tea that she was about to serve me . What? I said \"no I ordered lemonade . \" Massive eye roll from the sixty something waitress . I guess that it was my fault that she could not remember my drink order for all of fifteen seconds not a good sign . I waited for my food for probably fifteen to twenty minutes even though the restaurant was now emptying out and everyone had their food . It seemed like an eternity . When my food finally arrived here what was presented to me : five pieces of pale strange looking sliced barbecue . (If you have ever eaten at Sonny BBQ it was the same product although not as well executed as Sonny . ) I received a separate tray of onion rings . Two scrawny scraggly tiny pathetic hush puppies . ZERO SLAW . Lemonade that tasted like some cheap watery grocery store product . I make better lemonade from lemon juice water and artificial sweetener at home . I decided not to complain because (a) I was not \"that\" hungry and (b) I had little faith that my waitress could provide the correct order . Barbecue sauce options : (a) Eastern NC . Thin WATERY vinegary \"sauce \" and I use the term sauce loosely with red pepper flakes . I poured it on the barbecue and it immediately all flowed off - imparting zero taste and no heat . Worst eastern style BBQ sauce that I have ever encountered . (b) Western NC sauce . Thicker sweeter more ketchupy but not very good . The sliced pork barbecue? Hmmm . What confuses me is that there was a pink smoke ring so it looked semi - legit but there was no taste no smoke no nothin . It was also borderline dry . I should have ordered chopped barbecue instead I guess . The only other person that I saw who ordered barbecue order chopped and it looked good - from a distance . The onion rings were fairly good but they paled in comparison to the panko breaded onion rings from both McKoy Smokehouse in Charlotte and Judge Express BBQ in Hickory . Even Sauceman and Ranucci have far better rings . The hush puppies? Who serves TWO teeny scrawny hush puppies? You people are trippin . I was also disappointed that I did not get to sample the slaw THAT I ORDERED but it appeared to be the fine minced stuff put onto sandwiches so it was probably no big loss . My waitress Ms . Eye - roll committed the cardinal sin of letting my cup go completely dry . Sheesh ! Just before I arose to get my own refill a different waitress came by and refilled my cup . I noticed that almost everyone was eating the hamburger and onion rings . If I ever ate here again that what I would order but since I am not going to eat here again it is immaterial . The bill was over $10 which was about three dollars more than I expected and about $8 more than the food was worth . ',\n",
       " 'Simply amazing and completely fitting for a 500th review . I do not know that a more lengthy first sentence can do it any better . I will spare you from the I went to Spain bullcrap but I do know good Spanish dining on several different levels and Sol y Sombra overdelivers like a good night in the sack and to help others this is completely worth the 30 mile drive north for Central Phoenix dwellers . If you walk away from this review with two tidbits just know that the Tortilla Espanola (while basic - sounding and all) is the best $5 you will spend on a dinner . EVER . With its huge impressive wedge appearance it is more deliciously prepared and more filling than expected . Also know that the wine list is lengthy and very comprehensive but in an excellent way . While I love Lola Tapas in Central Phoenix for its urban and sophisticated simplicity this is one area in which it cannot compete . While the evening was more delightful because of our mailing - list 50 - percent - off skillz it should be even more noteworthy that such a thing is possible if you get off your duffs and give a brotha your email . Among other highlights would be the Pollo Colonial (a savory mix of sweet and spicy chicken curry) Grilled Calamari Spicy Garlic Aioli Grilled Prawns Grilled Asparagus . But the most surprising of the night were the grilled brussel sprouts . WTF? I do not even like that shit . But they grilled them with garlic olive oil and seasoning and if you do it that way it is ten times better than any veggie a teen would hate . The Patatas Brava were just ok . I still ate them but they were a little more crispy than I care for . The setting was impressive . The dining room is grand stylish and luxe in its understated way - - so symbolic of Madrid . The layout and colors are complementary trendy and tasteful all at once . The patio is incredible if you can swing it . There is not a bad seat in the house as the views from the second floor at DC Ranch are all great . The host was accommodating given we were 10 minutes late (and called ahead) and the servers and sommelier were definitely helpful and steered us toward the right white wine we wanted for taste and value without trying to do the whole upselling crap . The wine was excellent and was so fragrant and inviting that Melissa purse had to have a taste . Sol y Sombra is a definite five star destination restaurant that is worth it if you are coming from Central Phoenix West Valley or SE Valley . ',\n",
       " 'It been some time since I have had a new good taco experience . I had the opportunity to look for one tonight with several other Yelpers so I took it . Chicago Style Taco Shop is in a little North Las Vegas strip mall on Craig Rd cross - street Ferrell (_not_ in the spacious plaza with Smith and whatnot) . The restaurant itself is pretty much a hole in the wall too with seats for perhaps twenty . Even the cash register is on a narrow ledge with the credit card machine closer to where the customer tends to stand than where the cashier does . The owner and his wife were the only ones working . They moved to Chicago but came back to start this business and they seem nice . I got offered free samples after I would inquired about their Taco Tuesday specials (which are $1 . 50 but just for the ground beef and chicken) and those cups that I received were at least one - third of the actual protein of a taco . The menu has pretty much everything that you would expect in a casual Mexican restaurant : tacos tortas burritos taco salads quesadillas a few breakfast and dinner options desserts and traditional drinks . There are also nachos and something that they call Windy City Fries ($5 . 99 for a \"small\" and $11 . 99 for what must be an unimaginably large portion) . Gotta say that the fries themselves had a great balance of crunchy exterior and fluffy interior and they were decked out with plenty of meat and toppings (cheese pico de gallo guacamole sour cream in sauce form) . I could see myself ordering fries on my own so thanks a ton to Stefany V for sharing tonight ! All of the tacos (whether $2 . 50 for certain premium proteins or $2 for the rest) come with a double - stack of corn tortillas oiled and fried (but not to a crispy) plus your choice of veggies (had to go with onion and cilantro instead of lettuce and tomato the latter of which feels too Americanized) and salsas on the side . The tomatillo salsa is mild but the other sauces (the seedless green one and red sauce) were medium hot (depending on your palate) and were somewhat uncomfortable to use . I tend to prefer spots that pick the salsa to complement the meat because it becomes a guessing game for a first - time customer like me to make the right choice . I ended up trying most of their proteins and I will list tier them from my most to least favorite : - Tripas : intestines can be weird to some but these burst with flavor and may be my new favorite because they are less overpoweringly salty than what I expected . - Pastor : out of the tacos these were my second favorite . They are the rendition with caramelized onions and they are on par with the only other pastor tacos in this style that I have had (which at another local taqueria actually) . The meat is moist and delicious . - Barbacoa : made from beef cheeks and a perfect topping for Windy City Fries . Gotta love the fat . Wish I would had this on a taco to see how well it would have worked out . - Cecina : this is actually a refried beans sandwich with the tortillas as one bun and a giant hunk of tender beef as the second bun . Visually impressive and also flavorfully satisfying . - Asada : did not enjoy this diced steak too much on the taco because it was not marinated as far as I could tell but it worked great with Windy City Fries . - Pescado : could flip flop this with the asada . Big hunk of slightly dry fish that did not have that much flavor alone but picked up a lot of flavor with the tomatillo salsa . - Chorizo : finely ground seasoned pork . Better than the one other version that I have tried in that it really bursts with flavor without being too salty . - Carnitas : kinda on the dry side which is an unfortunate trend that I have noticed with carnitas in general . Lots and lots of protein on a carnitas taco though . - Picadillo : ground beef . It marinated and has corn and green beans (perhaps among other veggies) but it was underseasoned . - Lengua : beef tongue . just not much flavor here with zero caramelization in the gray meat . Ranked this so low because it one of the premium tacos . - Pollo : chicken . Underseasoned . Enough said . Overall I experienced enough hits that I could see myself easily returning . . . but only if I ever found myself in the neighborhood . It a great local taqueria for people residing in this part of North Las Vegas or in neighborhoods even more distant from the heart of Las Vegas . Otherwise just bookmark this for when you are really that bored of all the other options . ',\n",
       " 'Sweet owners ! I got the beef bowl a little on the sweet side with lots of onions and the Kakiage Don mmmm . . . Japanese omelette with pieces of shrimp tempura all in a miso broth with ramen so hangryyy I ate for two bwahah ;) I would def come back and eat here some time . ',\n",
       " 'Delicious ! My first visit . I have been hearing rumblings about trying this place so I had to stop by . I came in on a Saturday for brunch . First impression walking in was this place is smaller than I would have expected . The server sat us and was very friendly . My friend and I shared the pork belly benedict and the shrimp tempura tacos . Both were amazing but my favorite was the tacos . The shrimp was nice and plump and the sauce was just amazing . I was actually sad that I only had 1 and a half because we shared . The presentation and color of the food just screamed \"eat me ! \" . I also had coffee which was so smooth . Yum ! The owner came by and checked on us to see if everything was going well . I did not realize he was the owner at first and I did not catch his name but he was very respectable and was really genuine about making sure we had a good experience . Served seems to be picking up by word of mouth because driving by I would not have noticed it . Maybe they are planning for all the doctors to come in from the nearby offices? This place needs to be in the district ! I hope this place picks up and can get a bigger better location . I will be back ! ',\n",
       " 'I have been meaning to try this coffee spot out since I moved back and never seemed to come this direction when I was in need or wanted a coffee but I finally made the conscious effort and came here a few weekends ago . This is a small coffee shop with a few tables outside as well as wicker furniture . The inside is pretty much filled with tables not much space to move around if there were lots of people on the inside . They have a drive - thru which most people seem to use instead of coming inside . Since it was a hot morning I decided to have my coffee in - house and enjoy the AC . Even though this place is small it was nicely decorated and everything seemed clean . They have a bookshelf full of games for those that want to spend some good time here with friends and have some fun . This place has a large menu with lots to choose from . I had a hard time deciding on what I wanted to have . Their hot drinks come in 12 oz $4 16 oz $5 20 oz $5 . 75 and their Over ice & Blended drinks as well as their Smoothies and Ice Teas come in 16 oz 24 oz and 32 oz . Their prices on those depend on what kind of drink you get . I found that overall their prices are a bit higher than other coffee shops that I have been to here in the area . I got the 24 oz Carmel Toe coffee drink which cost $6 . 25 . It was pretty tasty but a bit too sweet for my liking . It had a lot of caramel flavoring in it that overpowered the coffee taste . Definitely not worth what I paid for it . The lady that took my order was very patient and knowledgeable of the menu . Since the menu does not say what is in each of their drinks she was kind enough to explain what was in the drinks I was interested in getting . My guest got the Peanut Butter blended coffee which was really tasty . They use actual peanut butter and not some flavoring for it and you can tell the difference . A must try for those that love peanut butter . Would I come back again? Definitely ! ! ',\n",

The batter was laid on a bit heavier than I care for but it was still good batter . The chips were nice long slices . . . perfect . The tarter sauce was slightly sweet I prefer it tangier .

       " 'Boba ! Yes I said boba . Boba as in \"a name for the sweet chewy tapioca balls found at the bottom of the Taiwanese bubble tea boba tea drink . \"There are few places that have boba in the Valley and after seeing a sign out front of Red Kimchi on several occasions I finally decided to go pay them a visit . I walked in at an odd time . . . around 5pm on a Tuesday . I was heading to a meeting and not sure how long it would be so I wanted a little something to hold me over until dinner . The restaurant was empty except for all of their staff sitting at a table in the back eating . I felt like I was interrupting but once I was in I was not going to turn around and walk out . I came in for boba and I was going to leave with boba ! I felt kind of awkward as I just wanted a boba to - go but they sat me at a table while I waited . . . I perused the menu of boba choices and narrowed it down to either green tea mango or strawberry boba . I asked the guy for his input and he asked if I wanted it to be low cal or not . When I said yes I would prefer the low cal option he convinced me to go with the green tea flavor . Imagine my surprise when he brought me my drink five minutes later and it tasted like ice cream ! I really really doubt it was low cal but I decided to \"suck it up\" quite literally . . . and it was delicious ! I took a menu with me and since then decided I need to return sometime soon to give their Korean food a shot . Hopefully when I do it will be a less - awkward experience . If you are up for joining me for Korean sometime let me know ! And regardless go check out Red Kimchi boba and yelp about it so I can see what you think ! ',\n",
       " 'Black Bear Diner is the epitome of what America is today : obese gluttonous and having a deadly fear of anything that even sounds like exercise . Go in and count the number of men in there with a 36 inch waist or less . . . you MIGHT make it to the end of the fingers on your first hand (and let not talk about the Wagnerian - built female patrons ! \"Rubenesque\" would be a kind description) . Now the restaurant itself : if you can sneak in there without your fitness trainer seeing you do so Black Bear Diner is THE place to drown in comfort food . The cooks in Goodyear have recently been replaced or must have been because the Reuben for example no longer drips in grease on your plate . The food is almost always good and the women who wait on the customers undertipped underpaid and underappreciated (believe me : they deserve to be tipped well beyond the 15% standard . . . especially as meals are pretty cheap here and the bill will be small) . Whether the management knows how to hire or the girls just bust their tails because they are afraid one of the patrons will roll on top of them if service is too slow I do not know . My favorites : the fried chicken the aptly named Volcano (pancakes sausage eggs etc . ) which will cause your blood sugar to erupt like one ; their Reubens Club sandwiches . . . they are all good : you cannot go wrong . Beware Sunday mornings when well - dressed Church goers mob the place as well as Fridays when they have their all you can eat fish fry . And just in case you really were able to find pants with elastic waistlines do not forget the cream pie desserts . In summary while the food is far from gourmet it usually quite tasty comes in large quantities and will leave you full for a long time afterwards . I recently returned to Black Bear Diner after a 3 year absence because I was in the mood for a sinfully caloric breakfast . The waitresses had no problem recognizing my rotund figure even though I had lost 40 pounds in my absence replacing Volcanoes and Club Sandwiches with exercise and a moderate diet . After telling me how wonderful I looked one of them asked me how I did it . \"Simple \" I replied . \"I stayed away from here . \"Black Bear Diner - it what America all about . ',\n",
       " 'Italian is not my #1 choice but my husband has picked Deflaco for dinner twice in two weeks ! We were so pleased after our first visit that we went back not too much after . This place is great in that they have made - to - order sandwiches pastas and pizzas and also a wide selection of groceries . The first time we went was on a Friday night & it was packed ! Even though the line was long the time it took to order & also get our food was reasonable . I decided to get the Grilled Veggie Sandwich & Penne Mostaccioli side salad and my husband got the Calzone & Tortellini Salad side salad . The sandwich & side salads were both very colorful and tasted great . I think the sandwich would have benefited from having the herbed mayonnaise inside the sandwich instead of on the top to really get the flavor of it on the veggies . I honestly should have just asked for an extra side of it since I always like there to be a generous amount of spread sauce but still I enjoyed it . I was a bit hesitant in ordering the Penne side salad because it had salami & pepperoni . The meats did not have a strong flavor though so I was not even able to tell that the pasta salad had any meat in it (until I ate the pieces of salami & pepperoni) very good ! The tortellini side salad was equally good and in this one as well the ham did not have a super strong flavor . I would recommend either one but if I had to pick I would go with the tortellini . My husband enjoyed his calzone so much that he got it both times we were there . The first time he got a 10\" one with mushrooms and the second time he got the 12\" one with sausage & mushrooms . The calzone was was really cheesy and had quite a bit of toppings . The best part though (in my opinion) was the marinara sauce that came with it . So good ! I had gotten the Margarita Pizza the second time & even the 12\" was huge I was literally able to get three meals out of it . I enjoyed the flavors that were on it but this would not be my number 1 place to get a pizza at . . . yet . I am interested in trying out just a cheese pizza with toppings & the White Pizza too . Overall 4 . 5 stars for flavors ease of ordering & the good service (especially considering it a grocery store) . We saw them bring out fettuccini alfredo & lasagna to other tables & they looked amazing . I cannot wait to go back & try their other menu options . ',\n",

       " '***Like many restaurants in Las Vegas Border Grill is a multiple - location restaurant ; while it might not be the most original Vegas dining experience the kitchen does a good job of churning out quality food with great consistency not found at many big brands on The Strip***Las Vegas especially The Strip is filled with second location restaurants from big name chefs . Border Grill in Mandalay Bay is one of them . Several of these restaurants are disappointing especially due to how it feels like quite a few Vegas kitchens are phoning it in because they are going to get a big customer base regardless of the quality . Border Grill is not that way though . Border Grill features upscale Mexican cuisine and while it may not elevate Mexican cuisine to justify the high price point food is prepared with consistency here . My lunch started with a complimentary basket of hearty and crunchy tortilla chips . The chips came with a trio of sauces with two of them being surprisingly spicy for somewhat mainstream Mexican cuisine . For my entrée I had their chile relleno which I enjoyed quite a bit . The roasted poblano was filled with a really good thick and stretchy Mexican cheese . The poblano was nicely cooked and flavorful . The outside crispy crust was good and not too greasy . The chile relleno came with sides of two kinds of rice and really good pureed black beans topped with Mexican cheese . For dessert I had their salted chocolate chip cookies with condensed milk ice cream . Of all the restaurants I have ever been to this was probably the best bang - for - the - buck dessert I have ever had . At $6 the dessert included not 1 not 2 but 5 large salted chocolate chip cookies . And the cookies were delicious . They were fresh out of the oven and were nicely crisp on the outside and soft on the inside with warm and gooey chocolate chips (perfect chocolate flavor) . The cookies were accompanied by two generous scoops of condensed milk ice cream . The ice cream was very creamy and not icy and it delivered on its name by really getting across the condensed milk flavor with every spoonful . Service was friendly and quick . Their lunch prices vary . Some items like the chile relleno are priced about right given that it is Vegas but some of their more entrée - dishes are in the high - $20s range and are probably not worth the high price tag . In terms of the décor Border Grill is okay . It is far away from the casino (near the convention center at Mandalay Bay) so you do not get the disturbance of cigarette smoke like you do at several other casino restaurants . Border Grill offers both indoor dining and an outdoor (and covered) patio . Border Grill is a good spot for a satisfying and slightly upscale lunch . I have been to the Border Grill in Los Angeles and it is about on par with this location . While Border Grill is known for serving upscale Mexican cuisine several would say that Border Grill does not warrant their high prices . I would agree on that point to a certain extent . Rick Bayless Chicago - based restaurants (especially Topolobampo) truly elevates Mexican cuisine by integrating hard - to - find Mexican ingredients and churning out moles of incredible complexity . Border Grill does not come close to that . But judging Border Grill on just what it really is which is an upscale restaurant with Mexican flavors it is a worthwhile lunch spot in Las Vegas - - especially if you find yourself at Mandalay Bay which is quite far from other notable Vegas casinos . I noticed that Mandalay Bay no longer offers complimentary self parking . I imagine it is because they struggle to secure parking for their hotel guests during busy times . It is kind of a nuisance given how almost every hotel on The Strip offers complimentary self parking . ',\n",

       " '\"It not THAT far away \" I told my harried Kay and we drove DEEP into the South Hills for the promise of good gourmet burgers and macaroni and cheese french fries . \"DARREN ! WE RE A FEW MILES FROM CANONSBURG ! \" she screamed as we passed such stalwarts of this suburb dining scene as Dorido Gil Cafe and the South Hills Clubhouse . Dr . Auslander our chiropractor is to blame . The man (his folks own Weiner World ! ) has become a fan of my reviews after he found my write - up on his practice recently and mentioned to me that a new burger joint had opened in our sector of the metropolitan area . With burgers always on my brain I convinced Kay to drive and drive and drive . . . BnDz sits in a typical suburban shopping complex near a trolley stop . Its exterior recalls Chipotle while its interiors and overall business model falls somewhere between Burgatory D Six Pax and Dogs and Five Guys . Table service only occurs after patrons place their orders up at the register . Standard builds like the Chicago Dog or the BBQ Bacon n Buffalo Burger are there for the indecisive but for the mad scientists there are the \"Create Your Own Masterpiece\" menu sheets on which patrons can check off the boxes and turn them in to an employee . Once that done one can pour a soft drink from the self - serve soda fountain find an open table and wait to be served . The cooking action happens in front of the counter in full view which is where I wish I could have sat . A metal grill steams and flames while fresh red red kroovy ground meat slaps the hot steel . Oil bubbles and growls once freshly cut fries are dropped into it . Drama unfolds once large takeout requests are phoned in . I decided to make my own monster using paper and pen : 8 ounces of Bison ( ! ) cooked medium - rare (there is no other degree to cook a burger) dusted with garlic and sweet onion powder (yes they do rubs) American cheese chipotle aioli leaf lettuce tomato red onion bacon and avocado on a white bun . This brings me to one minor complaint . My avocado was forgotten . The cashier hostess will punch in your order as she looks at your specification sheet which leaves a bit of room for human error . Might I suggest an automated scanner of some kind of like the machines that electronically grade standardized tests? That or the sheets could be have a carbon copy on the bottom so a hungry bugger like me can verify his order . Another thing to kvetch about : The (vinaigrette) cole slaw was a dud . I sampled Kay and all I tasted was black pepper and dry cabbage . All of that was dismissed however once our burgers dogs and fries came to us in red plastic baskets via the jolly beaming owner who seemed to know that we had ordered well . That bison patty was literally bleeding and when I sank my canines into the burger all I saw was crimson sweet crimson - - a literally sweet crimson . I thought to myself \"God how could such a massive fierce beast taste so delicate and candy - like?\" the squishy roll and saccharine fixings making it akin to cake the blanket of exquisitely melted canary - colored cheese nearly dripping like a yellow ganache . A frank was also customized with honey mustard onions and a pickle spear after requesting it be deep - fried filled with cheddar (a semi - dangerous dog) and placed within a poppyseed bun my culinary cunning proving brilliant upon first bite . The Mound O Friez were shared by Kay and I and Jesus would Guy Fieri go berserk over this creation . Imagine if you will oh jaded eater some immaculately twice - cooked and properly seasoned \"O\" - worthy french fries topped with bacon bits cheddar AND good simple venerable scratch - made Mac n Cheese . Imagine further . Imagine a real al dente macaroni topped with a sharply flavorful bechamel sauce . If this was Cheez Whiz I will be stunned cause they did somethin to it ! The frites had that crisp - vs - fluffy quality we all want in our gold tater shards the bacon adding fatty briny goodness and chewy texture while the liquid cheddar rained orange creamy luxury over the entire debauched party . BnDz also offers desserts but Kay wanted to have some ice cream and the nearest place was Bruster putting us onto Library Road for the journey home . Epilogue : As Kay drove up Washington Road with some out - of - towner friends of ours to the Mount Lebanon Primanti Brothers this evening she noticed a familiar sight . \"Darren ! Look ! \" she called out . There is now a BnDz only minutes from us in Mount Lebanon . It did mention franchise opportunities on their website . The lady was not pleased with me for causing Friday night unnecessary mileage . I still say it was worth the excursion though . Ha . P . S . My mother makes an amazing cole slaw when she feels like doing so . Doug Baros should get in touch with her . He and his crew wo not be able to make enough of it . ',\n",
       " 'A perfect example of Vegas neighborhood eatery . Small welcoming friendly serving food with attitude . What do Korean Filipino Peruvian and down home American food have in common? NOTHING . Except that they are all on the same menu at Served . Not to fear non - American dishes are not 100 percent authentic but represent well . They are all boldly flavored with no regard if they pair with one another or not . With their large portions there is very little chance you will be ordering two mains at the same time . Note : Breakfast review (the full starters and lunch specials menu is also available) . The comp crispy cinnamon dusted flour tortilla chips are crack in a basket and a great way to whet the palate . As a starter the loaded truffle parm nuggets with roasted wild mushrooms is solid and actually as advertised . Crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside Yukon gold wedges and a plethora of meaty well seasoned wild mushrooms dressed with real truffle oil and a load of parm . A handful of vegetal micro greens adds freshness . Good eats . For mains it all about the bennies . All showcase a well made hollandaise with just the right touch of tarragon vinegar and beautiful soft poached eggs with perfectly fluffy whites . The base differs to best suit the dish . All just work once the egg yolk is burst and mixed with everything . For example the \"Turf Side\" with sliced filet aggressively seasoned EVOO coated roasted mushrooms on grilled sourdough ; burst the yolks mix it up the flavors blend beautifully . The same is true for the \"Korean Spicy Pork\" . Juicy spicy slightly sweet well marinated pieces of grilled pork atop crisp shrimp rice balls . Again burst the yolk for creamy richness that reduces the spice and blends it well with the seafood . Micro greens garnish all dishes not only making them look good but to add freshness . Tip : Wednesday is Industry Day . Check with the servers for rotating specials . Limited list of libations including a bottomless mimosa (orange or guava) option . Vegas style start to the day done right . ',\n",
       " 'First and foremost my review is of the dining experience overall so that people who have never been there know what to expect . As cheap sushi goes it not terrible . You are definitely not going to like everything on the menu but it easy to fill up on a couple things that you do like . The portion sizes are decent and the quality is pretty okay . Nothing amazing or life changing about this place . I usually come here for lunch for a quick bite when I do not have time to wait in a nice restaurant . Now one thing to consider is that the service is horrendous . Oh god it awful . You are drink may be refilled once if you are lucky . But no need to get upset about it . Just be vocal with your requests . It a nuisance sure . I too am used to be treated like a damn princess when I dine at a nice restaurant so I get it . Being ignored is annoying . But this is far from a nice restaurant so do not walk in expecting that kind of service . You are just setting yourself up for failure if you do . Instead just accept that this is the culture of the restaurant and speak up . You are on your own folks . It one of those symbiotic relationships where it like \"I hate you you hate me but I want your cheap sushi and you want my money despite not really wanting to work for it . If I had wanted five star service I would have gone to Kabuki and you know that you cheap whore . I knew exactly what this was when I walked through the door . \"So yeah . That the Teharu experience in a nutshell . ',\n",

       " 'I had a coupon for a 14\" pie from United Blood Services and I stopped in to use it yesterday . I sat at the counter . The woman running the counter area gave me some menus and she got an iced tea for me . I ordered a 14\" pizza with cheese and pepperoni . While waiting the server brought me three garlic knots . They were hot and fresh but they could have used more garlic . The knots were accompanied by a small container of hot marinara for dipping . In a normal amount of time another server brought me the pizza and kidded me when she realized I was dining solo . Later she came back and asked me if I wanted her to box the rest to bring home . The pizza was good . I prefer thick crust pizza but this was a credible thin crust pizza with a small amount of tomato sauce and more cheese and pepperoni . I was impressed by the staff . They were very friendly and they realized from the get go that I was a first time customer . I would recommend them and I will probably be back if I m in the mood for thin pizza . I also had a chance to peruse the menu and saw the Italian dinners they serve . Maybe that would be something to try . ',\n",
       " 'Yes . This is probably some of the best if not the best Thai I have had in Vegas . Yes better than Lotus . Honestly Lotus is good but it not the best . Just because a place is popular here in Vegas everyone seems to think it the best . WELL I DON T THINK IT IS ! :)We had :TOD MUN GOONG Shrimp cake served with plum sauce - Super tasty and the plum sauce was very good . MIANG POU - Lettuce wraps . These were good but actually my least favorite . It has fried coconut and I hate coconut in any food . But if you like it go for it . MOO HONG - Braised Pork belly . Super super good . The sauce was stronger than I expected but I was very happy . PANANG CURRY - Very good but holy hell was it spicy ! I would have preferred it with chicken or shrimp though . GREEN CURRY - this was tasty for me . I m usuall not the biggest green curry fan but it was very good . They serve it with pork which again - - I would probably prefer it with chicken or shrimp . PAD THAI HOR KAI w Shrimp . This stuff is it . Best Pad Thai we have ever had . Even better than what we had in Thailand . . . insanely good . Overall the service was excellent the food was delicious and the prices are amazing . I m only sad that I missed out on some spring rolls . . . ',\n",
       " 'Fuku Burger has been on my radar for quite some time . Today is the day I act upon indulging here . The reviews from prior individuals and past experiences made me want to eat here . The Fuku menu is the simplest piece of literature that I have ever encountered . Plus it comes color coded for authenticity . First off I wanted to give my taste buds a ride Fuku style . Saving my appetite all day for this moment the order went as this :Had the number 1 Fuku Lucky Burger . I am not a fan of onion or tomato so opted to withhold these . It left this burger with the meat cheese and Fuku sauce . The meat is flavored with a balance of spices that give it a kick . The burger is moist and is held between a fresh heated bun that fits perfectly in ones hand . Exploring the menu more I had the number 2 which is the Tamago Egg Burger . Again I had the onion strings withheld . This meat patty was the same amazing quality as the first one but comes with no cheese . It does however have a fried egg . The egg was cooked perfectly . The yolk broke over the hamburger patty provided more moistness and delicious flavor to the burger in that same bun as the number 1 . The Fuku sauce is sweet like a sweet and sour sauce . It is not hot at all and gives the burger a rich sweetness glaze fire flavor mix . The number two has a sweet taste since teriyaki sauce is lightly drizzled over it . The Furikake and wasabi mayo that are mixed together in the bun with the egg give the burger an edgy and rich flavor . Out of the two burger I would recommend the Number 2 \"Egg Burger\" it edgy taste fill the old factory senses but do not set them on fire . It a delicate balance of sauces that mesh nicely together . There are no sides to the burgers but one can make it a combo and save $2 . The garlic fries sounded the best so making one a combo brought down the cost of the burgers . The restaurant serves alcohol mostly beer . Beer and burgers are always a win win . The soda fountains are Pepsi products on tap . The service here is impeccable and amazing . The cook is a genuine marvel . The time between when the order is placed to the table is less than ten minutes . The food is cooked to order as well . The decor of the restaurant is fun fabulous since there are four televisions all going with different channels . The closed caption is on if you want to watch and read the words . They offers board games in a wide selection such as family favorites like Monopoly or Jenga . Now should you eat here of course if you have schedule conflicts the staff here takes care of that by being open to 3 am Friday and Saturday . Sunday to Thursday they can Fuku you till 1 am . ',\n",
       " 'I had no ideas this place was here . So small from outside I drove passed here many times for the past 16 years but did not even notice . On the day I came here I missed the exit from the freeway and was driving up Hayden Rd to get back to Scottsdale eventually when my friend said there should be a good seafood restaurant nearby and when he spotted this place we decided to try here instead . Taking the stairs down I felt like I was going down to a wine cellar . It such an old school I felt like I was back in time . Apparently they have not changed for over 40 years . I liked their classy ambiance . Server said halibut was fresh so we shared halibut ceviche . Fish was fresh and really liked the taste of ceviche . It was so hot that night fresh appetizer was perfect choice . Yakimono Hawaiian ahi had a great flavor . One of the best ahi I had before . Outside was charred just perfectly I enjoyed every bite of my ahi . Portion size was very big . I did not have enough room left in my tummy for desert . Server was as friendly as he gets . He sounded like he been working there for a long time and knew what he was doing . I had such a good time there that night I hope I can come back here again soon . ',\n",
       " 'This was a random stop in while in Montreal and it turned out to be one of my favorite places ! ! We were looking for a spot to grab a drink and snack before dinner and noticed a lot of people dining outside on their \"patio\" (technically the place is underground so perhaps they were dining \"upstairs\" . We were looking to sit at a bar so we headed down the stairs expecting to find an emptier space (everyone was looking to dine outside since the weather was good (by Canadian standards)) and we surprised to find a pretty lively crowd downstairs as well . The bartender was extremely friendly (actually seems most Canadians are) and he made the visit that much better . A pretty extensive craft beer list and I was shocked to see a Stout Berliner blend which I knew I had to try . Stouts are not really my thing and I found this to be a bit too Stout - y for me but the Berliner sourness was still there and overall I was pretty impressed by the combo . We opted to share the Tartare Combo with fries which was both a Salmon Tartarte and a Beef Tartare . We took our time trying to decide which was the better of the two but could not decide ! Quite a nice dish . Like I said the bartender made the place and if you are looking for the craft - beer basement hang out kinda vibe then this is definitely the place for you ! Great spot ! ',\n",
       " 'LVT is the best bar in Lakewood . Or maybe it seems that way because I am always drunk in there . Steak dinner for $7 . The wings are pretty good . I think it is a good place to go . Madison bars are always the right choice . This place still kind of sucks but the whole world kind of sucks . ',\n",
       " 'This place is awful . If quick and dirty brunch is your thing they definitely have the dirty part down pat - - everything is filthy - - but service is extremely slow . FILTHY . Dust everywhere dirty cups that were poorly washed and still have lip stains on them and food that looked worse than you could make yourself at home while hungover were not even the worst part of it . And do not look up unless you want to gaze at the dust bunnies living in the paper lanterns above your head . Not sure how they passed a health inspection looking like that . The slow and rude service was the worst part . Our waitress was nice ; the problem was with the manager or owner dude who I will now refer to as Bruh (pronounced something between bro and bra ) . It was taking a really long time to get my order . The waitress came by and put an order that looked like mine in front of me . Seconds later she came back and took it away . She had mistakenly brought it to the wrong table . She seemed new . No big deal . So the manager owner Bruh was quite rude and started yelling at her across the restaurant as if to make her feel stupid that she did not know where table 6 was . I thought that was unprofessional and felt bad and embarrassed for her . I do not support places that treat their employees disrespectfully especially so openly in front of customers . Not cool . Several minutes later when he was coming by I got his attention and told him that it been over half an hour since I ordered my food - - though in retrospect I would say closer to 45 minutes - - and that waitstaff keep coming by and telling me it coming that I have not seen it yet and that if he could refund me my money so I can go eat somewhere else . He said \"F*** yeah bruh ! \" and stormed to the cash register . He was so mad ! It was a definite \"what the heck?\" moment . I went to follow him somewhat confused as to what was going on and if I was imagining how mad he was right now . I heard him angrily say something like \"that GIRL over there \" as if to purposely be condescending and disrespectful . When I got to the register I tried to calmly explain that I was leaving because it was taking a really long time . He yelled \"I do not care ! \" He was really mad and rude making a huge scene as if he took it personally . His behaviour was so ridiculous that I asked \"Why are you so mad?\" and he responded that I was mad and giving attitude so he was mad back . Great answer . The professionalism and maturity definitely shined there ! I was trying to calmly rationalize with him to calm him down then he started raging saying that his place is organic and that I could go to Egg Smart across the street and be served faster which sounded like he was trying to act like his place was better than Egg Smart . And I m pretty sure organic eggs cook just as fast as factory farmed eggs . I buy organic eggs Bruh and make them at home and they do not take that long to make . Organic food does not take longer to cook ; I eat at local natural and organic restaurants all the time and Saving Gigi takes the (organic dust - covered) cake for the worst place I have been to in a while . His behaviour was completely unwarranted and irrational . He was blowing it out of proportion . He was so mad extremely unprofessional and seemed to take everything personally . He was rude to me and dropping F bombs every few seconds . I was really shocked . I have never seen anything like it . I think I was more confused than offended . I decided to stop trying to rationalize and calm him down because people like that are incapable of rational thought . He was a total jerk extremely loud and obnoxiously overreacting . Very dramatic . This guy is ridiculous and needs to chill out . This was one of my only \"hipster\" impressions and it left a bad one for sure . We left checked Yelp and ended up going somewhere else which also seemed to be run by hipsters - - if the definition of hipsters was mid - rise tapered jeans and plaid - - but they were friendly polite and clean so I know that this dirtiness and rude attitude was not a hipster thing this was just a Saving Gigi thing . I will never go back here or the sister restaurant Saving Grace . If price is your reason for going here it not even that cheap . The value is not there . We went to Union on Ossington and paid $4 more for a much better dish - - naturally raised freshly ground beef burger - - so if you are broke and that why you are thinking of going here I would not even count that as a pro bruh . It low value . This place is expensive for what it is (which is crap if I was not clear) . Cole Notes version :If waiting 45 minutes for eggs and pre - made sides slow service with a rude unprofessional manager dirty glasses with lip stains hair stuck to water carafes and an ambiance full of dust bunnies is your idea of weekend brunch then definitely hit this place up ! Maybe if you are lucky you will get to be called \"bruh\" and referred to condescendingly and experience some F bombs and watch him rage at his staff ! ',\n",

       " '\"Hey what are you doing here Vintner Grill?\" That is what you will think when you drive up to an office complex in Summerlin to grab some food . However do not worry you wo not be confronted with office cubicles and fluorescent lights once inside . Inside reminds me a bit of Encore - style although not quite as exquisitely executed . French Country meets South Beach was the verdict my gal pal and I issued . The floor is a beautiful faded painted wood . The predominant color is white so the feeling is very airy and clean . It gets my vibe stamp of approval especially the outdoor area with lanterns and a fire pit which I had my eyes on . They also have a private room . Lots of men in suits eat lunch at Vintner so I am going to say that it is a respectable choice for a \"power\" lunch . My friend and I were there for more of an intricate lunch the kind where girls order a lot of food a couple of drinks and eat really slow while pondering . We should do this more often . I found their clipboard menus odd but I guess that showcases their commitment to changing it often . The menu has salads flatbreads focaccias sandwiches a couple of fish entrees and then some usual suspects . If you like cheese this would be a good place for you as they have an extensive selection for a custom cheese plate . I would not say service was the most attentive but it was pleasant . When my friend accidentally threw her drink across the table our server was quick on her feet and she graciously brought a replacement . Lost vodka would have been a tear - jerker for sure . The bread basket is a nice selection including a pretzel roll but I was surprised that all of the bread was cold . Is that a new thing? Am I unsophisticated expecting warm bread? I am asking in seriousness because I have noticed it at a couple of places . We started with a flavorfun crab cake . There was a lot going on in the crab cake but that is what made it both flavorful and fun . It was not jumbo lump meat but I still ate it in under a minute . I had a turkey burger which was a little dry even for turkey but filled with herbs . The bun was wholesome . It came with little thin French fries . I appreciated them because they allowed me to eat numerous fries without feeling like a complete glutton . My friend Cobb salad looked nice but it was not a showstopper . We finished with the strawberry shortcake and this is a sleeper . It is not a real decadent dessert but the flavors are scrumptious . The strawberries were just a bit tart ; the whipped cream was not heavy ; the biscuit tasted like cake and the balsamic reduction was not overpowering . I would say the food is hovering between 3 and 4 stars but the atmosphere and culinary effort bumps it up to a 4 star for now . I will be back just to make sure . Maybe I will wear a suit . ',\n",

I DO NOT need somebody to toss my salad or pour my dressing for me thanks . I also think that your drinks and additional items are a huuuuge rip off . You are ostracizing your original customer base by enforcing a one time through trip to the salad soup bar . Do you really think that the customers that frequented your establishment are going to think that the decrease in value is worth it now because you put some fresh rosemary in a tiny vase at each table and planted some lettuce out front? I got news for you field kitchen . . . you are digging yourself in deep this time . Oh and the tip you slipped in to everybody check? Classy touch . ',\n",

Starting with service there are a ton of suit dummies walking around this place yet the service was average . Server was friendly but we did not get good vibes . My other problem was with the whole restaurant design . Ugly ass blue carpet in the middle . Looks like they spent a lot on renovating but it looked terribly overpaid for . Felt very tacky . Not to mention the fact that as we were escorted to our table the host stepped on and killed a cockroach nearby one of the VIP rooms beside one of their food carts - we should have just left right then but hey we already paid for the Groupon . The food was just nothing special at all very bland . The ribs were ok but needed a lot of their hot sauce not very tender . Shrimp with walnuts and a yum yum style sauce was heavy and meh . Ginger lobster needed more seasoning to bring out more flavor . Shrimp fried rice was so bland we laughed about how easy it is to make it better at home . Cheesecake was standard . Overall would not recommend this place to anyone . It overpriced crappy bland Chinese food . Felt like take out but we were served by tuxedos . If they serve fried cockroaches on the menu that I was unaware of I will accept the fact that we saw a dead one on the way to our table . 2 5 and I think that generous',\n",

I wanted the full experience so I filled my car up with gas left it with Ivan to get the signature wash and headed inside to check out the general store and enjoy some breakfast . I admired the bakery treats to my left as I entered but I would already had a cup of coffee that morning so I kept on walking toward the restaurant counter . . . I ended up with a delicious 2 egg breakfast . I asked for my eggs over medium and for my sides I chose the creamy grits and sliced tomatoes . For toast I asked for a whole wheat tortilla . I love that option . I enjoyed it all ! I found the service to be friendly and the seating options comfortable . While I did not make any purchases from the store beyond my breakfast I enjoyed looking around as they have a variety of gifts and convenience items . It an awesome one - stop shop ! Clean bathrooms to boot ! I left with a full belly fueled up for the day and feeling great . My car did too ! Tom Thumb is a unique gem of a business that is absolutely worth a visit even if you have to drive out of your way to check it out .

It is a hole - in - the - wall super casual and very authentic . I LOVE their salsa bar that also had fresh radishes cucumbers roasted peppers and more . BEWARE : The peppers are pretty spicy ! But thanks to their refreshing bottled grapefruit soda the numbness went away in no time . I ordered 3 tacos - pollo carne asada and carnitas . All were delicious and I would absolutely get them again ! My favorite was the carne asada the marinade on the meat was so tasty ! Also my fiance ordered a rajas gordita (vegetarian) and it was so fantastic . This is an absolute must . It is a tortilla pocket filled with cheese roasted jalapenos and hatch chiles . Lastly I ordered their bean soup which is pinto beans with a few different meats and a fantastic broth . I recommend eating at the restaurant to get an authentic experience and of course take full advantage of their fresh salsa bar . They even had a cute young mariachi band playing in the background . We will absolutely be back ! ',\n",
       " 'Try Nandini in Tempe . I do not like to leave reviews unless they are positive or at least constructive but in this case this restaurant deserves the poor review I m about to leave . First the silverware was not very clean as it was quite spotty neither were the water glasses . The apathetic waitress co - owner not only did not welcome us but she did not bring enough menus over when she got around to coming out from behind the counter she did not offer a beverage and she was VERY slow as if she really really wanted to leave which she did part way through our service . She also did not ensure we had silverware so we had to walk around and rob two other tables to get some as did a larger party who was dining a few tables away . What was the most disappointing was that I ordered the Bay Leaf Platter which was a sampler of many of their more popular dishes . Chicken Tikka was one of the times advertised in the description however when I pointed out that it was missing the waitress pointed to the red chicken and said that was it . I responded by telling her she just told me moments ago that it was Chicken Boti - which it was . I challenged her and told her it did not look like Tikka and that she just said it was Boti . She said she misspoke and pointed to another item and said THAT was the Boti . Again total BS . After she left I called another young waitress over and asked if it was Tikka she confirmed it was not and then called the owner chef over . He said Boti is \"like\" Tikka so they did not bother to put the Tikka on my platter even though it is advertised as part of the meal and the first waitress said Tikka was on the platter . Bear on mind this was now near the end of the meal and he kind of offered to bring me the Tikka but in a very discouraging manner saying there was no point . Yes he said that . Please let me add that I had Paneer Tikka Masala for lunch with a friend at her home and I am also very familiar with Indian food . I felt so insulted that they lied to such extent assuming I m just an ignorant American who wo not know the difference . Let me also tell you that Boti is nothing like Tikka . They man also continued on with his lying over the items on the platter but I gave up and decided it was a worthless argument I just wont go back . Their integrity is lacking they have no pride for the products they execute they insult the intelligence of their customers and the rest of the food was below mediocre . One more thing the platter was supposed to include a salad and chutney . They called a corner of dried out cucumbers \"salad\" and the chutney never came . AWFUL ! ! ! ! I would also like to add that the owner response was full of fallacies there were no calls made ahead and as far as the coupon we only had one which was not even mentioned until our check came and by that time the horrible waitress owner had already left . I also think when a business chooses a rebuttal which is unwise to begin with it should appear professional and without pettiness and false information . This woman is clearly attempting to discredit me and my review . We were a party of four and all of us had the same thoughts on the experience . And yes I was lied to and told very different things based on who I asked . It was ridiculous . I paid my bill and left a tip . Just not going back . ',\n",

Huge thin crepe stuffed with slices of bananas and drizzled with rum and caramel sauce . I liked the nice touches with the candied pecan topping and side of Chantilly cream . Would have been awesome of they flambeed the thing but still solid 4 stars . The black coffee is also very good here - great balance of bold slightly tart and ending on a smooth note .

So good that I was willing to smuggle 50 of them on my flight . . . but TSA was not having it bahaha . ;) I will say that I was not a big fan of the fries . Both the animal style and regular style tasted like NOTHING to me . . . like empty potatoes if that makes sense .

       " 'I CANNOT BELIEVE THE DISRESPECT AND AUDACITY OF THIS PLACE ! ! I NEVER GIVE THIS BAD OF A REVIEW AND I NEVER HAVE BEEN AS OFFENDED AS I HAVE BEEN HERE . AVOID AT ALL COSTS . SHAME ON YOU FLAVORS SHAME . My partner and I had bought a groupon for the brunch buffet here which we were excited for . We went around noon or a little after when we were stopped by the cashier lady . She told us our groupon was not valid because it was a breakfast option ONLY available Sunday through Thursday (it was Sunday) . We clarified that the groupon said it was valid for Sunday and considering they only offer Brunch and no breakfast option it must have been valid during Brunch hours or else why would it be valid on a Sunday . . . . riiiight? ! She started to get annoyed and telling us to leave and come back on a day that served breakfast . She also said \"YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY BREAKFAST OPTIONS HERE AT THIS HOUR . WHAT TIME IS IT? ! DO YOU THINK THERE S BREAKFAST BEING SERVED HERE? GO AND COME BACK SOME OTHER TIME WHEN ITS BREAKFAST . WHAT YOU PAID ISNT WORTH WHAT WE SERVE FOR OUR BRUNCH BUFFET\" Though there is breakfast becuase its brunch . . . . right? that what brunch is . . breakfast and lunch . Also if they did not want people to purchase groupons and use them for their buffet why put them on the website? ! She kept yelling at us and waving her hands as if to slap my partner . She got so angry waving her hands at my partners face that I decided it was time we left . NEVER AGAIN . IF THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR PATRONS THEN YOU DONT DESERVE MY MONEY . I SUGGEST EVERYONE AVOID THIS PLACE . GO SOMEWHERE WITH GOOD SERVICE . ',\n",
       " 'Before I get into the review I just like to know why WEST Sunset Rd is simultaneously located to the EAST of E . Sunset Rd and also to the West ! ? Who is the historical drunk and opium smoking individual or commission responsible for naming this road in Las Vegas and why is this confusing anomaly allowed to persist? Could it have contributed to the low test scores of Nevada education system and the general dismal geography knowledge of the Silver State? This is the burgers and hot dogs restaurant inside the updated local casino now called Wildfire Sunset . The fact that the internal atmosphere inside the casino and thus Wildburger does not reek of aged cigarette is reason enough to bump it up a star . Plus it looks clean the staff does a good job clearing tables as guests leave after their meal and even the plastic beverage cups look refreshingly new all contribute to a positive guest impression . They have a simple menu . And is operated like a fast food restaurant where you place and pay for your order and wait a few minutes while the kitchen prepares your order . For the late night and early morning crowd (11pm to 1pm) they offer their breakfast menu (Build Your Own Omelet Bacon & Egg Platter Pancakes and their Wildburger Signature Breakfast Bowl) . $5 - $8They also serve hot dogs (Chili Dog Giant Hot Dog and Giant Bacon Wrapped Dog) . $5 - $7However I will go out on the proverbial ledge and hypothesize that most are there for something from the burgers and sandwiches portion of the menu . You can build your own or order one of the pre - conceptualized burger combo . The cashier told me the most popular is their Classic Cheeseburger but they also have The WIldburger (basically the Classic + their signature coleslaw) a Cajun Turkey Burger (if you do not like the red meat) or a Crispy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich . $7 and up depending on how many toppings and sauces you want on your order . The Classic Cheeseburger was decent . Loaded with veggies and 1 2lb Angus beef patty and comes with a side of fries or onion strings . The portion is large enough for all except amateur competitive eating contest hopefuls and beyond . Chicken Wings and Boneless Wings with 9 flavor options . $0 . 75 each when ordering 8pc or $0 . 66 each when ordering 12pc or 15pc . Two Salads selections in case you are in the mood for some crisp fresh salads . Desserts selections are limited to Deep Fried Twinkies and their Made From Scratch Ding Dongs . I tried the DF Twinkies mainly to see what it taste it and can officially cross it off my bucket list . It is a decent spot to grab a bite when you are keeping yourself entertained at this small local casino . If you are in the area by all means drop by but with Wildburger locations distributed in various parts of Las Vegas it is not reason enough to go out of your way to hit up this spot . Summary : Inexpensive food that is decent served in a clean and pleasant environment by friendly & helpful staff . 3 + 1 stars ! (This review is subsidized by Groupon Featured Deal)',\n",

       " 'Sushi restaurant or brothel?I had lived basically across the street for 2 years and had seen this hole - in - the - wall joint but had never been despite sushi being my favorite food . I figured it was time I check it out - I went there around 4 :30 on a Thursday in time for happy hour which is from 2 - 5 . I walk in and there not a single customer in the restaurant which was not a surprise considering I had never seen anyone walk in there . The place looked somewhat run - down inside and especially on the outside . I m greeted by a cute asian girl who sitting at a table on her laptop . I ordered a couple rolls off the happy hour menu (#4 and #7) for $5 each . Both we are good but I probably would not pay their regular price of $8 for either . More importantly let talk about how this place manages to stay open? Facts : - They have been open for at least 2 years (they were here when I moved here 2 years ago) . - I have been in this strip mall many times and had never seen anyone walk in the doors of JK sushi . - There were at least 3 employees working - Not a single customer in the restaurant besides me - The cute Asian girl (mentioned above) had a \"get boned\" bumper sticker on her laptop . My theory is they have something involving \"getting boned\" going on in the back . If they do not have some other way of making money I have no idea how they manage to stay profitable . I do not think I will be back unless I m really curious one day and want to see if I can purchase some \"extras\" in the back . ',\n",

The group was great but the acoustics were pretty bad since the hotel lobby was not designed for live music . The bartenders were great . I had a Peach Berry Gimlet ($10) to start that was good and followed it with a whiskey sour which was really good . My friend and I also ordered the Charcuterie ($17) to split . The plate was a bit smaller than I expected but good . The plate was a bit boring and did not match the description so I would not recommend it . I would stick to drinking here . The atmosphere is casual but chic . The bar area is casual but cute and they have giant blue chairs to sit in as well . There are definitely a handful of regulars but the majority of people were either young professionals or retirees . Not much in between . Overall this is not a \"cheap\" night out but the live music and great bartenders make for a fun night . ',\n",

We ran in to Pasquale himself on our way out the door sitting at a table surrounded by newspapers . We tried to say hello but dude refused to give us anything but a sneer and his backside .

       " 'I was in town for a friend wedding and was looking for a good brunch place that would be vegan vegetarian friendly (for me) and also have gluten - free options (for a friend) . My local friend said she had tried Zenith for lunch and that it was awesome ! She also said that the brunch was supposed to be even better so the three of us decided to go for Sunday brunch . What a funky cool spot ! The thrift shop upfront provided more than an eyeful as we grabbed our coffees and waited for a table . We were quickly seated and handed menus . I ordered the barbecue seitan sandwich and both my friends got the roasted portabella plate with mashed sweet potatoes and greens . Then it was on to the table groaning with all kinds of salads : fruit salads grain salads pasta salads vegetable salads etc . Wow what a spread ! I chose about five different kinds to try out and returned to my seat . Our main courses quickly joined our overloaded table . Upon taking a bite of my seitan sandwich I immediately noticed how sweet it was . It had some spice to it but the overwhelming flavor was sweetness . My friends took bites of their dishes and said the same thing . We then all tried our various salads . Good but again too sweet ! What was going on here? Did whoever prepared the food have a serious sweet tooth? At least the cakes were good and sweet as expected . The food was okay but not nearly as good as I was hoping for . My local friend said lunch was much better and was also confused as to why it was so different this time . Hopefully it was a one - time thing and the food is normally seasoned better .

       " 'Already a fan of the location on East Tropicana I was excited when Tia Shirley B . informed me that a new Taco y Taco would be opening in this part of Henderson close to where I work work out often and have many friends who live in the area (including Shirley B . ) . A friend and I headed here last Saturday after a long training ride ready to get our taco on . Just after opening at 11 :00am we walked in to find a spacious restaurant complete with bright lighting high ceilings a bar and staff that greeted us heartily ; this used to be the Republic Kitchen & Bar restaurant so it may be the nicest taco place I have visited . I was quite surprised to see a DJ mixing tunes at that time of day but not a bad thing . There were a couple of other customers already eating and the place got progressively busier during our visit . Set up like the other location there are stations where you can order tacos burritos quesadillas bowls elote (corn on the cob) fries nachos mulas and vampiros . Meat choices : al pastor asada pollo tripas carnitas cesos cabeza lengua trompa suadero buche and chorizo . Vegetarians have an option of soy chorizo and panela (pasteurized cheese) . There a salsa bar with lots of options for you to add to your order . I had two al pastor tacos with pineapple a carnitas vampiro (two crispy tortillas with the meat and cheese inside) and Mexican street corn on the cob (elote) with the works (mayo cheese and chili powder) - - I was hungry one minute and then full the next . My friend had never been to Taco y Taco before and he gobbled up his food before I finished . This Taco y Taco gets five stars from me for the location the tasty food and the service ; I will definitely be here a lot .

       " 'Toast has gone completely downhill over the past couple of years . . . to the point where it is little more than a \"greasy spoon\" with more selection . I was originally enamored with this place because of its location and the quaintness of the establishment . Their breakfast menu is impressive comprised of gluten - free pancakes smoked salmon and eggs mimosas eggs benedict stuffed french toast among regular favorites such as omelets grits eggs and bacon . But popularity of the restaurant has led to a crowded restaurant where patrons are packed in like sardines and a \"get em in and get em out\" mentality . This translates to the quality of the food . From the time you place your order to the time you receive your plate it takes about 10 minutes . This is with a very crowded restaurant . How is this possible? \"Fresh Fruit\" is not fresh but frozen fruit that is thawed . Bacon is not drained but thrown on a plate where grease pools into the bottom of the plate eggs are over - seasoned greasy and burned . You could sop up two napkins full of the butter grease on pancakes that come out . Coffee tastes little better than diner coffee . Tea is Bigelow brand . At my most recent visit I made mistake of ordering the New Yorker : smoked salmon scrambled eggs and onions . The salmon was poor quality (fishy) and the onions were white not the typical red (no capers) and the whole mess was chopped up and mixed together and thrown in a greasy pile on my plate with a side of freshly thawed fruit with ice still in the middle . At $10 a plate I expect more . This review is based on the last several meals I have had at Toast by myself and with family members . No one was impressed and none said they would return . . . including myself . ',\n",

Do not tell me about this mixup just let me sit and wait nice . The manager did offer me a $5 voucher for next time for the wait . I got my order and headed to my truck . Once in the truck I opened the bag and the free cookie that was supposed to come with my order and was the FIRST item on the ticket was nowhere to be found . I went back inside and told the girl who rolled her eyes not at me but at the mixups and disorganization that seemed to haunting this place today . She gave me my cookie with a smile apologized and wished me a god day . Even the manager seemed flustered today . The food was good and being the first thing I ate today I was happy for the burger and fries . I am not sure if my stomach liked it as much as I headed straight to the bathroom when I finished eating it but my brain was happy . This is only the second time I have eaten here I am not sure if there will be a third time . The $5 off voucher he gave me I am sure will be passed to someone else as I probably will not be giving this place another shot . ',\n",

Sure enough I found it in one try . We sat at the bar and had a few drinks . The drinks were good ! Our bartender was very friendly and quick . Turns out the bartender and my friend had mutual friends . Small world ! I ordered some Hamachi Sashimi and Samba Rolls to munch on since I needed food . It came out fast !

       " 'I remember stumbling into Matt Big Breakfast years ago when I first arrived by car in Phoenix with my crash mate . . we were hungry and downtown . I was a new Arizonian and Matt looked like a regular Mom & Pop type of place . Once we found parking ( this was before downtown really arrived and it was still relatively easy) we ventured to Matt and surprisingly found this long line ! That kind of thing always intrigues me so we waited awhile and thus my first Matt experience was born . I remember it being very good basic but good . Low and behold when I was in my old neighborhood recently getting my hair blow dried up over and out I met up with that same bestie crash mate and we re - visited Matt . Only HERE in Camelback . Yes . The long line does still exist even at this location . No matter what time of day as I have been to said blow dry bar often and I always see a line at Matt ! Take note : that means it good ! Basic breakfast foods await you at Matt . The Hog and Chick is my personal favorite . It simple and it good : Two eggs any way ( I go for poached) ; home fried potatoes ; a thick slab of bacon ; toast of any liking and their homemade jam ! Matt uses high quality local & organic when possible on most of their items . Since I am not a fan of what GMO have done to us Americans . . . I look for that anywhere and any chance I can get it is a plus . The coffee is ever flowing as is the H2O for us parched desert people . The juice is fresh squeezed . What more can I say? Matt is simple basic and takes it to the level of greatness without really having to try . NOW as someone who loves to linger over a Bloody Mary or Mimosa at a weekend brekky? I would LOVE to see Matt bring those two things to their city restaurants . They have not . The Bacon Bloody Mary does exist at the PHX Sky Harbor location . . . & it amazeballs . Maybe in the future ! Matt has done something right . . . simple is good . . being basic is awesome . ',\n",

       " 'I love this Vegas buffet . I know the manager so that probably helps . I will save you the typical review focus points and get to what I love most ; endless crab legs ! And it got me to thinking . I wonder what I was in a former life . It had to be something that loved crab legs . But what could that be? What eats crab?Most crabs have many natural enemies or predators . Birds attack smaller crabs sometimes carrying them high into the air and then dropping them on boulders to crack their shells . Fish with powerful shell - crunching jaws also eat crabs . Many kinds of mammals from seals to raccoons also look forward to a crab dinner . Crabs have many predators in the ocean . If not a larger species sometimes crabs even prey on their own . With pinchers and hard shells it is hard to imagine what finds crabs so worth all the stress . However perhaps ocean creatures know like land lovers what the taste of crab meat is like even without garlic butter sauce . Maybe I was an octopus . The jaws of an octopus are known as the beak . These are very sharp and the bite of an octopus may inject poison . First the octopus catches the crab by landing on top of it then uses the suction discs to capture it and finally bite into its hard shell . For crabs the bite is fatal paralyzing the crab so that it no longer uses its pinchers to thrash allowing the octopus a tasty crab leg dinner . I m not about to inject an poison or get into a death dance with my dinner . Maybe I was some other kind of fish or sea creature . Dog fish sharks striped bass jellyfish red drum black drum cobia American eels and other fish also enjoy crabs . As larvae and juveniles crabs are especially vulnerable to attack by smaller fish sea rays and eels . As they grow older turtles like to munch on crabs as their jaws are powerful and able to crunch through the tough shell . I m not crunching through any shell with my jaws or picking on the little kids . Maybe I was a sea otter or seal . In addition to crayfish fish and frogs sea otters love a crab meal . In fact cape clawless and Asian small - clawed otters feed mostly on crabs . Sea otters eat about 25 to 30 percent of their body weight so otters go through a lot of crab in one day . Seals also like to feast on crustaceans such as crabs . In fact the crabeater seal from Antarctica is named for its love of crab . However mostly these seals like krill . Another variety of seal that loves crabs is the Weddell seal another mammal of the Antarctic Ocean . 25 to 35 percent of my bodyweight in crab meat ! Now we are getting somewhere ! Maybe I was an ordinary everyday hardworking crab . Adult blue crabs are especially known for their cannibalistic nature when it comes to eating their friends and family . Smaller or weaker blue crabs with issues such as missing limbs bad health parasites or other disabilities are the first to go in the blue crab chain of command . Younger species of crabs are especially vulnerable to older larger crabs who have no preference for what they eat while scavenging the bottom of the ocean . No that not appealing at all . There you have it ladies and gentlemen : Flavors The Buffet - favorite of sea otters and seals the world over ! ',\n",
       " 'I visited the Zenith yesterday for Sunday brunch with fellow Yelper Chelsea S . We would been wanting to do brunch together for awhile so I suggested the Zenith since I knew it was near where she lives and I would heard it was a really unique and cool brunch venue . Although neither of us are vegetarian or had tried a vegetarian brunch before we are both game to try new things so we decided to check it out . The first thing you notice when walking into the Zenith is the interesting kitschy antiques everywhere - - including suspended from the ceiling . Unlike the Beehive coffeeshop further down Carson St . which has similar interesting decor it my understanding that these items - - as well as the tables chairs flatware etc . - - can be purchased . I m not sure of the range of prices since I did not inquire though . The second thing that became apparent which I did not realize from reading previous reviews is that parties of two are mostly seated together with other pairs (i . e . communal family style seating) . That was not a problem for us since our tablemates were interesting conversation partners but if you are a couple looking for an intimate romantic brunch venue you may wish to look elsewhere . If on the other hand you are game for meeting new people by all means check it out ! As for ordering the setup is a hybrid of a prix fixe and a brunch buffet . All of the entrees which change on a weekly basis are the same price ($11 . 50) which also includes coffee or tea with unlimited refills . (I had herbal tea . ) Once you order you have access to the buffet tables one of which focuses on salads and fruit vegetable side dishes and the other of which contains an assortment of bundt cakes . For my entree I ordered the pumpkin pancakes . I was expecting wafer - thin flapjacks but they turned out to be quite thick moist and cakey - - in a good way . This entree was proof that vegetarian fare can be quite filling ! I was not as much of a fan of the side dish that came with it (not sure what exactly it was) but it added some welcome savoriness . As it were my selections from the vegetable buffet table added the savoriness I needed to offset the sweetness of the pancakes . They included pasta salad thai peanut noodles (?) chickpea salad spinach salad a piece of bread and some fruit as well . All of them were quite good and also filling in their own right . Finally I sampled several of the bundt cakes (double chocolate vanilla blueberry poppy seed lemon and orange lavender (?)) . While I enjoyed all of them too my favorite was the double chocolate due to its moistness . If you do not have as much of a sweet tooth as me you may prefer some of the other flavors which were less sweet . I m definitely glad that I tried the Zenith brunch buffet since it one of the most unique brunches in PGH for sure . Even if you are leery of vegetarian food I would encourage you to check it out - - I daresay you will be pleasantly surprised ! And of course it was great to share the experience with a fellow Yelper (Chelsea S . ) as well as our table mates and make some new friends while enjoying a delicious brunch ! ',\n",

       " 'I do have to preface this review and state that I am a fairly picky eater . But going to this fairly casual establishment I figured I would be fine . . . But no . . . I was overwhelmed . I felt SO uncultured . I had to Google basically every single menu item . I m not exaggerating . Everything on the menu was something (or was topped with something) I have never heard of . I was already feeling like I was not hip enough to be there but now I truly felt like I did not belong . We decided to try a few things . The roasted vegetables the skirt steak and the grilled pulpa . We received our vegetables pretty fast . We were advised that the plates would come out as the were finished . (vague . . . Weird . . . ) Those veggies were BOMB ! Perfect comfort food . We took our time savoring the yumminess and then waited quite a while for a RARE skirt steak . I cannot eat meat that pink . I had Googled the sauce described on the menu . Smelled good . . . Wish I would have had some say on how the meat was cooked . But never fear . . . Grilled Pulpo was on its way . This dish was the only thing I had not Googled . The menu description just said potatoes so lame - o uncultured me pictured some kind of potato dish . Ummm . . . After waiting several minutes for my \"potato dish\" a server walks out with a plate of freakin OCTOPUS . . . aka Pulpo ! It LITERALLY means octopus ! I m a fool ! I m basically 8 years old and simply cannot deal . My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his MASSIVE dinner while I sat reminiscing wistfully over the four pieces of roasted cauliflower and potatoes I devoured thirty + minutes ago while trying to avert my eyes from him eating TENTACLES ! Never ever would I had thought that the menu of such a light - hearted establishment would be so intense . The members of TLC were pictured just below the Bone Marrow \"shared plate\" . This is coming from a fairly absurd individual but does not that strike you as a bit comical? The movie Airplane ! was playing over my head as I was Googling the word \"chimichurri\" . They brought the check out in a copy of a hardback Garbage Pail Kids book and have you rate their service on a 5 point scale of \"dopeness\" . How dope were those sweetbreads bruh? ! ',\n",

Russell Wilson that is ! The place is great ! It split up in 3 sections the restaurant (found right when you walk in) with plenty of booth seating and TV to watch the game is extremely family friendly . The bar next to it houses an island bar with TV monitors allowing you to watch the game from every angle which also includes a \"Hawks Nest\" on one end (a nod to the Hawks Nest found at Centurylink) . Finally next to the bar is the gaming room with a pool table arcade games several flatscreen monitors with most importantly a huge wall projection screen spanning almost the entire area of the main wall ! It thoughtfully designed for all types of fans and viewers . I have been watching Seahawks games here for going on 2 years now . It is truly something special for die hard Seahawk fans as it by far the largest congregation of fans in Las Vegas every Sunday and is also home to the Las Vegas Seahawkers which is officially sanctioned by the Seattle Seahawks . There are anywhere from 200 - 400 fans on game days . The people that run it (Las Vegas Seahawkers) are amazing ! You immediately feel welcome the moment you walk in and are greeted with roars screams and high fives when the excitement kicks in during game time . The organizers of the Las Vegas Seahawkers do a tremendous job of MC ing organizing facilitating excitement during each game with chants the ceremonial flag waving during touchdowns raising the 12th man flag before kickoff and also hold a raffle for prize giveaways . They do everything possible to make you feel at home and welcome and make it a point to make sure that your time there is unforgettable . They even bring in Seahawks players and local Seattle celebrities to join in on the fun ! The last game I saw there the Las Vegas Review Journal (LV major newspaper publication) was present capturing the excitement and giving away prizes of their own ! It really like one big family in this place and is a must for any Seahawk fan looking to share game day excitement with their fellow 12th man on game day . Truly something special . To the gentleman (Ric B . ) who provided the less than favorable review . In the nicest way I know how I would like to say please pull your head out of your A$$ ! Perhaps you may have misunderstood what the rules were for the prize giveaways but in order to qualify fans need to wear Seahawks gear to receive a raffle ticket for the drawing (Seriously who does not proudly support their team on game day by wearing Seahawks gear especially when going somewhere public to watch the game? ! ) For those who for whatever reason forget their gear I have personally witnessed the club Secretary provide raffle tickets to those with no gear on that claim they are from Seattle . She is one of the sweetest most down to earth people there ! Finally unless you are hiding in a corner the entire time or are anti - social you are going to receive high fives until your hands hurt and hugs til your ribs hurt during the game so not sure what you mean by \"unsociable\"? I have met countless strangers that come in for a weekend usually in town on tourist detail and have bonded over the Seahawks with every single one of the them ! Every single visitor I have met that comes in for their first visit is always in awe of what takes place here . All I hear is : \"This place is incredible ! I cannot believe how awesome this is ! I will be back next time i am in town ! \" Frankly it very difficult NOT to feel the love from your fellow 12th man woman here ! So please Ric B . get off of your pretentious high horse and get over yourself ! In regards to the food and service both are excellent ! They have game time happy hour specials for food and drink - killer chicken nachos garlic fries and wings ! The waitresses are super attentive fast all smiles and are pretty damn cute ! Especially Vanessa - She the sweetest cutest there ! :) She ALWAYS takes good care us ! It pretty impressive considering there are hundreds of people at these events and she along with the rest of the staff pull off phenomenal service and hot food always attentive to our needs ! BOTTOM LINE (if it not already clear) Scooters is THE place to be for ALL SEAHAWKS FANS in Las Vegas on gameday . You will be warmly welcomed greeted with the \"Northwest Nice\" that we fans are known for and will find that just by being a fan in this environment automatically makes you family . :)GO HAWKS !

       " 'With our 3 year anniversary looming Kay and I came to Bistro 19 after striking out reservation - wise with several other restaurants . My lack of foresight became destiny for Bistro 19 gave us a scenic gourmet flight with no turbulence encountered . Dimly lit with wavy patterns decorating the fang - white walls we were given a commodious and comfy booth in the back of the dining room (it helps to mention that you will be celebrating an anniversary when you make your reservation) . Since our reservation was for 5pm an hour after their opening time we felt almost as if Bistro 19 belonged solely to us as we each cracked open the ornate metal - backed menus if only until the dinner crowd began to dribble in concurrently with the mild rain . A typically tasty Caesar Salad kicked off my end of this special meal . A crunchy plank of foccacia crostini bread came with the anchovies - garnished mound of fresh Romaine diced tomato and grated Parmesan the tart and milky dressing acting as the salad reason to exist countering the brine of the small strips of cured oily fish . If there was a textbook ideal for Caesar Salads this would have been it in terms taste and presentation . Pan Seared Sea Scallops were the appetizer of the evening and like the salad were made to shine by a tiny essential component . In this instance it was the inclusion of a bacon marmalade the exquisite union of brackishness and sugar topping the juicy quivering scallops which in turn capped disc - shaped croutons . A sensational smoked tomato vinaigrette that called up Russian or Thousand Island dressed an eclectic pile of mixed greens in the middle of the two pillars . Having poured through the menu online and at the restaurant I had trouble deciding what I wanted . All of the items were good good reads but either contained components I do not care for or were simply dishes I have had too often of late . I finally stopped dallying and arbitrarily chose the Black Tiger Shrimp . Fate once more proved that She had the upper hand . http : www . youtube . com watch?v = dfqSPFBU8vwPacked with artichoke spinach cream cheese (?) and a tomato parmesan sauce the fat gracefully displayed foursome of savory prawns surrounded a heap of cheesy risotto and more bales of spinach . The sauce was reminiscent of the dressing involved in the starter only that it was obviously served warm . Wolfgang Puck probably would not have approved of the dense risotto (he would likely thin it out with chicken stock) but it was tasteful enough that I minded very little lugging the shrimp through it before every bite . I had planned on indulging in the Caramel Popcorn Sundae after dinner but considering it was an anniversary we were observing we were brought a helping of the Banana Foster Napoleon to share complete with a lone candle sunk into it . Turnovers and baklava are easy comparisons with flaky meeting syrupy halfway . Gobs of scratch whipped cream kept things from being too decadent as tangy blueberries countered the hot starch of the banana chunks . A pastry pastry sitting in a shallow lake of saccharine goo and filled with a luscious vanilla creme we were left with no reason to complain and every reason to return (I want . . . to try . . . that sundae . . . ) . Bonus : We were not charged for the dessert ! Chef Jessica Gibson Bauer is to be thanked for providing us with such a thoughtful creative and relishable meal her apprenticeship at the Carlton (another amazing restaurant) proving invaluable . Gastronomers may the stars lead thee to Mt . Lebanon . Treat your significant other to a commemorative night at Bistro 19 whenever the date arrives . P . S . The service provided by Cheryl our waitress was peachy . P . P . S . Do not let Wolfgang have the risotto here . . . http : www . youtube . com watch?v = mRp2phlJWXAAgain its composition did not really bother me the non - chef but I could not help but think of the above clip as I partook in the risotto .

The architecture the designs the paintings . the chocolate \"waterfall\" that made me want to have my open mouth at the end of the cascading chocolate dripping from the roof (this is also inside the Bellagio ! ) they are all free to see . In the realm of free vegas entertainment I can safely say the fountains are at the top of the list . This is a must do when in Vegas . On a romantic trip? Do IT ! With kids? Do IT ! Alone? Do it . . . then cry because you are watching this alone ! These fountains are mindblowing ! It a choreographed show with massive streams of water shooting up and down - dancing to the music . Set up inside an 8 - acre manmade lake with over 1 200 nozzles shooting water out as tall as 460 feet the water almost dances to the music . It does get super crowded so get their early and plot out your spot . Almost every spot around the railing is a good view . The show times vary from weekdays to weekends but the shows start every 30 minutes (in the afternoons) and every 15 minutes (in the evenings when it more packed . ) Your best bet is to get it done in the early evening - you want to see it with the lights lit up . From their website :*On Sundays Fountain show times begin at 11 a . m . and run every 15 minutes for the Fountains Brunch at Jasmine .

       " 'Great date night spot with intimate setting . The way they set up tables far away enough from others we enjoyed our conversation throughout dinner . They have nice wine selection . They have options to pair with each dish but we chose to order a bottle instead . Unfortunately a bottle my date chose did not quite work out . We both had a feeling it will take time but what we underestimated was how long it took before it became good . They transferred wine into decanter but it took a long time for wine to become good . Around the time the main dish came our wine started to taste where this wine should taste . They do have nice crystal wine glasses though . . They serve four course menu here . They had two options for the soup . Soup was a bit too salty we both did not finish . Salad was very good I especially enjoyed brussels sprouts . Flavor and texture was just right I would have enjoyed larger portion of the salad . Nice presentation too with different colors . Main dish was nicely done . I enjoyed my fish and his steak . Around this time my wine tasted really good with oaky smell to it . When he looked at the menu he knew I was going to order fish for my main dish so he chose this wine . It just took a long time . Desert and service was just average . I enjoyed the ambiance more than anything . ',\n",
       " 'Metro has happy hour between 2 :30 - 4 :30 Tues - Thurs all pizzas are half off during this time . It was a rare occasion that I happened to have a Tuesday off so some friends and I decided to have lunch here . We ordered a large salad and a large pizza half Honolulu and half Sunspot . They also brought warm bread and butter to the table . It was more than enough food for 3 people . The pizza was good but sadly it was a little watery and soggy . The Honolulu comes with ham pineapple bacon and green pepper and the Sunspot had chicken artichoke tomatoes basil and garlic . You would think with alllll of those toppings that they would have made the pizza a little bit more well done . Nothing is more unappetizing than a pizza that is watery . I enjoyed the pizza but it not the best I have ever had and the only time I would probably come back here is for happy hour . ',\n",
       " 'In response to the owner of this formerly wonderful restaurant you sir have an interesting way of skirting the truth . By virtue of the way you responded to my nephew ( Sean F . - 5 7 16) yes it was my birthday you sound like a guilty man . If it was the case that larger parties are usually concluded after 2 . 0 hours do not you think it would have been helpful to let my husband know that information when we made the reservation? As far as leaving the table to watch the derby my husband DID tell the young lady when he made the reservation that watching the derby every year is one of our family traditions . She told my husband that it would not be a problem . It seems like both of those situations could be solved with a little better training . Oh yeah I wonder who should be doing that? The final straw was your contemptible response to me when I asked if you cared that you were ruining my 60th birthday . You said \" I DON T CARE IT S MY 70TH & I M MAKING MONEY . \" So anyone in Yelpland looking to celebrate a special occasion with special people in your life do not go to Hoffstots in Oakmont .

       " 'This is one of my favorite places for lunch in Phoenix . They make wonderful sandwiches that are not for average sandwich . They are very creative with their menu though you can still get some classic sandwiches ! The downside is they have a very small dining room inside and they sometimes screw up phone in orders . Other than that their sandwiches are absolutely wonderful and their sides are the bomb . They have great macaroni salad although they do not have it every day and sometimes they sell out so get it whenever it is available ! Staff is very nice and friendly and they will always ask you how everything is . I will have to say that when I showed them my order was wrong they fixed everything quickly and willingly . A tad pricey or else I would go here more often . Usually lunch with a drink is around $10 - $11 . ',\n",

       " '6 15 16Mom and I have not been to this location in a long time as we go to one on Scottsdale Rd . (between McDonald and Lincoln and listed in Paradise Valley) since it is closer to where we live . We noticed that this location is less - busy than the other which is not telling much as the other location does not get very busy either at least not at the times when we go which usually is around happy hour before 6 pm . At the time of our arrival around 5 pm there was only one Caucasian woman seating and serving the entire restaurant - - about six different parties two of which arrived before ours . She seemed very busy taking large strides almost - sprinting and trying to get water glasses to the tables and answering questions . By the time we would placed our orders it was around 5 :20 pm . At 5 :25 pm a second employee a young Asian man walked in . Ah more needed help has arrived . Thai iced tea : Good but very sweet . Make sure to order an extra glass of ice to pour into to help lessen the sweetness level ! https : www . yelp . com user_local_photos?select = k_gUwf5hGjiGEJ - TUaP2RA&userid = M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPAGuava mimosa : Listed on the happy hour menu under Tropical Mimosas for $5 . Other options include mango lychee and pineapple ! Very happy to see this offering as I am allergic to oranges so I normally avoid mimosas . I have only seen grapefruit** mimosas offered elsewhere so to see guava and lychee as additional choices impresses me ! I will be back just to try the other choices . Btw the guava was good but it could have used a little more sweetness . I sipped this one first before trying the Thai iced tea just to check its sweetness level . I suggest adding sugar to taste or perhaps Tottie could offer a moscato d asti as a sweeter alternative to the sparkling wine that is used . Green curry with beef : Delicious with good - quality beef (tender and not sinewy) but the curry was too watery . https : www . yelp . com user_local_photos?select = DVLvAWTrbWqmlSOn4r2zfQ&userid = M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA Love that the veggies included can be omitted and substituted according to food issues allergies . Also love that Tottie offers steamed egg noodles as an additional side for someone like me who is allergic to rice . Price for side noodles has increased to $3 . 50 a bowl when it was only $2 a year or two ago . Almost double the original price but still somewhat reasonable . If the cost of the noodles were to increase even more AND the curry remains watery (as opposed to silky) I may have to look elsewhere for my green curry and egg noodle fix . Soft - shelled crab curry ! https : www . yelp . com user_local_photos?select = OcU0raJQ6HsfVLf0jaBI7g&userid = M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA This was the dish that brought Mom and me back again and again . I have decided to stay away from crab this year as the last time I had it my allergy symptoms were worse . Simply not worth the pain and suffering . Mom enjoyed this dish and it looked beautiful . We did notice that it came with less crab pieces (four halves instead of the previous six - - check out my older photos) . It been awhile since we last visited so it would be nice if the menu listed the number of pieces as well as the cost of additional crab ($3 each and sliced into halves) . Note that you may want to ask for a few pieces placed on the side if you intend to take leftovers home - - that way you may revive them in the (toaster) oven and will not soggy upon re - heat ! Will probably just go to the one on Scottsdale Rd . from now on since we like the Filipina server there . We also usually see Tottie herself roaming around and she usually comes and greets us which is always a nice touch . ',\n",

       " 'I m a fan of Dim Sum and usually try to make it a point to try them when I come across one . To this day I have yet to find a place that blew my mind . Din Tai Fung was probably the closest (is that even considered dim sum?) but in the more typical joints where they come around with the trays I have never been super impressed . We decided to try Ping Pang Pong since it was in a casino and we figured it would provide the necessary cleanliness that I find to be generally lacking in dim sum spots . We got there 15 minutes before they opened on Sunday and there was a line of 3 - 4 parties waiting in front of us . By the time they opened there were another 5 - 6 parties behind us . Shortly after we began dining the place was full . Good sign . The wait staff was surprisingly Chinese - I say that because this is inside the Gold Coast and I would have thought the wait staff would be more diverse - and resulted in a service very typical to other dim sum restaurants . They spoke little English and often called out the dish in Chinese even after realizing we were not Chinese . The décor was clean and typically nice for a casino restaurant so this part we enjoyed quite a bit - dim sum in a clean environment . The food was actually quite good . It was quite distinctly lacking of the dumplings and shumai that we were looking for they just kept telling us it would come later and they would come in trickles . But what did eventually come - shrimp shumai and shrimp & pork shumai - were very good . But alas no har gow no rice noodle rolls with shrimp (they had one with beef . . . ) and just not enough choices of these little pieces . What they did have though were interesting and not common . Congee porridge is common and theirs is good . They have a large bowl for the table and a smaller bowl for one . They had cooked congee in spice broth which were excellent and clams in similar sauce that were great also . Their souffle - type dessert (they only make 10 per day) was delicious as well as the custard flavor rolls . One big issue I had with them were that the dessert dishes started coming out first and just kept coming around . Why do they do that? Bring out the porridge and dumplings first ! We kept having to tell them \"later after we eat ! \" as the dessert trays passed by probably at least half dozen times . They have got to fix this . But all - in - all a good meal and our meal for 4 came to $49 plus tips . That not a bad deal and perhaps I can overlook some of their glaring shortcomings . 3 . 5 stars is more appropriate but I will bump up a half based on the quality of what we actually did get to eat . Table - for - 1 Factor : May be for regular lunch & dinner but for the dim sum brunch it probably not a great option . ',\n",
       " '***Avenue B kitchen turns fresh and high quality ingredients into light dishes that are also flavorful vibrant and filling ; their reasonable lunch prices also make Avenue B a great option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh***Avenue B sits in a neighborhood that kind of reminded me of Silver Lake Los Feliz or Atwater Village . The restaurant has a simple café - like décor but there are great touches . I liked the use of purple as well as the hanging light fixtures - - rustic but also trendy . The restaurant has a great neighborhood restaurant feel to it . Their lunch menu is reasonably priced and it features dishes inspired from many different cuisines . There is a Cobb salad and a potpie as well as a Thai - like dish and a banh mi . I went for one of their modern Asian entrees which was black sesame crusted salmon served with a salad of seaweed cucumber surimi and mushrooms . It also came with a sauce of sweet soy and a garnish of carrot and daikon . The salmon entrée seemed like something you would find at a run - of - the - mill Asian fusion restaurant but it was so much better than that . The salmon was very fresh and they got a nice crispy crust on it . The salmon was served medium rare and it was very moist but it still flaked very easily . I also liked the great flavor of the black sesame as well as the sweet soy sauce . The garnish of carrot and daikon was fresh with a light crunch while the seaweed salad was cool refreshing and flavorful . I liked the mix of the warm salmon with the cool salad . It was a very light dish but it was also a very flavorful and filling dish . If I were going to nitpick I would say that the entrée seemed very close (maybe too close) to the Asian ingredients and flavors that influenced it . But when the ingredients are high quality like this (especially the salmon) and they are handled so well it is hard to complain (5 stars) . I also tried their flatbread which was topped with cheese grilled artichokes prosciutto and arugula . This flatbread had a great crust which is where a lot of flatbreads can go wrong . It had a great flavor with the right amount of char ; it was thin and crispy but also with a little bit of a chew . The arugula was great - - leafy peppery and nicely dressed in a light vinaigrette (you often get dry arugula on flatbread) . The generous portion of the arugula kind of overwhelmed the small portion of prosciutto but the prosciutto was good (not dry meaty and with the right amount of saltiness) . The cheese was good too . In terms of other toppings they used the woody part of the artichoke which would not be my first choice but it was actually a good contrast to the leafy arugula and it made the artichokes stand out in a good way (4 stars) . For dessert I went with their blondie which was filled with pretzel buttercream and garnished with bruleed green apple . The bruleed green apple was great . It was reminiscent of a candy apple but with the use of a tart green apple versus the more sweet red apple (the more traditional apple used in a candy apple) . I think the tart apple combined with the sweet crust was great . That candy apple - like taste made from a technique you often see with crème brulee was kind of eye opening . And when it was mixed with the sweet and chewy caramel it became a dessert that felt very nostalgic but also sophisticated at the same time . The pretzel buttercream was good . You do get a little bit of a pretzel flavor with the addition of coarsely chopped pretzels though the buttercream did not have a prominent pretzel flavor . What I liked about the buttercream though was how it was sweet and creamy without being overly sugary like a lot of buttercreams (4 stars) . I also tried their housemade brown butter ice cream and it was great - - great flavor smooth creamy dense and firm (without being hard) - 4 stars . Service by Lauren was great . She was personable nice knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive . The food also came out at a good pace . Prices for lunch were reasonable . Most of the entrees were in the $12 - $15 range and several of the starters were $8 and below . Avenue B is a very impressive restaurant that showcases fresh ingredients in satisfying flavor combinations . There is also a lot of talent in the kitchen as the flatbread and salmon were both perfectly to near perfectly prepared . All these great things plus Avenue B reasonable lunch prices make it a great choice for a delicious upscale lunch in Pittsburgh . Parking is available on the street by meter . It is not that difficult finding a space during lunchtime . ',\n",
       " 'Hot Head Burritos - the good the bad and the ugly . Let start with the good . The dining area is new and clean . The service was perfectly pleasant but they still seem to be training so the line moved a little slow . I ordered the spicy chicken bowl with black beans brown rice sautéed onions (extra charge) corn salsa guacamole and cheese . They topped it with their hot salsa to make it picy chicken . It was ok but not as good as their competitors . The Bad - We ordered the Queso of course because I love to try different restaurant styles . Well I was highly disappointed . It was bland and had a weird texture . I asked for some hot salsa to try to improve the flavor . No Bueno . We did not finish it and would recommend skipping this side item . The Ugly - Unfortunately I witnessed one of the workers take a piece of food from the prep area with her gloves on eat it from her fingers and proceed with stirring the other items . With the same gloves on she served up the next customer that walked in . I do not know about you but I do not find that acceptable . It made me wonder if she did that before I walked in . For this girl I hesitate to visit again . ',\n",

Known only as \"The Silent Hunter\" by family and friends my demeanor morphs from free spirit into a wily predator about to viciously attack his prey when at a buffet such as this . Here are my tips for a successful buffet outing at Rio Seafood Buffet : * On the day of the buffet no lunch or unnecessary snackingAt the buffet :* No salads breads or any other useless filler foods . Their conspicuous presence near the crab legs and shrimp could throw you off your game . Do not fall for it . * Your table waiter will take your drink order . Be prepared for its arrival in a large red plastic cup roughly the same size as one of those Big Gulps another clever ruse designed to slow your eating stride . Too much liquid forget it . * The shrimp . Oldest trick in the book ! It still in the shell not good . Time is your biggest opponent here Eating slowly will cut your consumption rate by almost half . (I have no empirical data to support this just a guess) I know it tempting but do not bother with the shrimp not now at least . We will come back to that in a a moment . And this brings us to the piece de resistance ; the crab . A couple of problems however . Let walk through them shall we? First its still in the shell and cold sitting on an ice bed since God knows when . Second its snow crab not much yield for the effort . Here what you do . Bring a pair of gloves with you to the restaurant . White gloves with which you will inform your server of their concealing a rare medical condition ; \"I have got leprosy\" you inform her \"Unless you want a rotting - skin shit - show on your hands you will need to remove the shells from my crab . You will also need to heat it up for me . . . my gums are sensitive to cold . Oh and bring some clarified butter and maybe a pound o shrimp while you are at it peeled of course . \"Now eat my friend . Eat until you mightily swell like a blue tick or until the manager asks you to leave or you explode whichever comes first . Now go and enjoy . ',\n",
       " 'Firstly ignore all the one star reviews docking points for the unauthentic - ness of the food . Their aim is not authentic Indian cuisine but high quality gourmet Indian fast food . It simply absurd to give it one or even two stars . Anyways once you walk in to the place be prepared to pick your jaw up from the floor ; the place is pristine immaculate modern beautiful . The menu is straightforward . The options are varied but not the least bit confusing . I got the chicken tikka plate with naan . After you place your order watch them cook orders through floor - to - ceiling glass panels . There are 4 massive tandoor clay ovens (cutely names eeny meeny miny and moe) in which they cook the naan bread and meats . After you have picked up your jaw ordered your food and admired the cooking of your meal ; if you have ever dreamed of giving your hands the treatment of a car wash (I know I have) stick your hands in the automatic touchless hand washer outside the bathroom for a quick 12 seconds while bobbing your head to their modern music played at an unobtrusive volume . Ok so your food should be ready now . You go and return your vibrator that they give you to tell you when your food is done . Grab your food and retreat to a a corner table in the glass paneled seating area so that nobody sees your pig - like stuffing of food into your mouth - no room for conversation here . The chicken is perfectly cooked tender and juicy . The rice soft and fluffy . The naan was fresh airy stretchy and light . The spicy mango sauce was great and the hot sauce perfectly on point . Once you are done give that hand car wash thing one more go just for kicks . Grab a delectable mango lassi and some samosas (both amazing) and devour them in the drivers seat before driving home in satisfaction of an excellent meal and a great overall experience . Ok now for my complaint : pricey for the amount you get but we expect too much anyways . If you want American sized portions go else - whereAgain they have nailed the American - Indian experience an easy 5 stars . If you want authentic Indian food go elsewhere (NYC or Chicago) or make an Indian friend . Definitely going making a return visit next time I m on the east side ! ',\n",
       " 'This place used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas . What the hell happened? I told myself that I would not mind paying a 15 dollar cab ride(one way) to Chinatown to eat here but it was terrible this time . The won tons here used to be great . The roasted duck was awesome . It just not the same anymore . I hate to say this but I think MGM Grand Wok is a lot better than this place . Not only that . . . . . . . . . . . the prices are comparable to casino restaurants . After the cab fare . . . . . . . . . . . Sam Woo is probably more expensive . A real disappointment . For a real decent Chinese restaurant off the strip . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . try Joyful House . They have the best soy sauce supreme shrimps . It more of a dinner place but I love their food .

It is on a very busy corner at 7th Street and Osborn . But fortunately there are no valets for parking ! You may self park your own car and I love that . I m the odd ball yelper . I do not go here for the Enchiladas . I go here for the soup part . . . . Yeah uhm . . . . did you notice the word \"Soup\" in the name of the restaurant? Hehe . . . I love their tortilla soup so much that I could easily eat it a couple times a week . You can chose the meat toppings to add to your soup or chose the grilled veggies . These options are the same for the tacos and enchiladas . I also add a touch of Pico de Gallo and a bit of the Hot salsa . Perfection in a bowl for me . They also serve a corn chowder that I have yet to try . Actually I found my favorite item and I just basically stick with it . Jajajajajaja ! Return factor :100% . . . . I m headed there now . ',\n",
       " 'No reservations here at Le Vin Papillon but I arrived before the dinner rush started and so I did not have too long to wait until a single stool opened up at the bar where I had terrific service . I let the waiter make recommendations because the big chalkboard was in French and while some things are close enough to English that I can mostly fake it I was at a complete loss here . So maybe I got up sold to more expensive dishes . No worries they were fab . A great glass of French red to start with and for some reason I was offered seafood to go with it . Okay I rolled . An order of crab legs which were messy but well cracked so that I mostly just had to dig out the meat . It came with a small pot of clotted cream which probably made sense to the head chef but not to me . I enjoyed it anyway . Second dish was a sea urchin which I would never had before and it was quite tasty and fresh . Not cheap but I did have the advantage of a strong US dollar that made it reasonable . Great service and a super restaurant . Definitely date worthy other than you might be waiting a bit for your table . Head across the street to the Burgundy Lion for a drink while you wait ! ',\n",
       " 'Before you read on the 5 STARS is because I m comparing it against ALL other buffets I have been to & especially the ones in Vegas . onto my BRIEF SUMMARY ! - Buffets are usually about quantity not quality but Bellagio gives you great quality food & a whole lot of it - Smaller than Rio but better quality - Great service - Wasted food goes to Pig Farm - Quality DesertsEvery time I go to Vegas I have officially been there 3 times in the last 6 months I have got to hit the Bellagio Buffet . Bottom line . Yes you should go to Rio because it the world biggest buffet but when you are done poo - ing your brains out you will want to spend an additional 5 bucks and go to Bellagio . VEGAS = LINES . So if you are gonna cry about waiting in line for the club or a really great restaurant then do not go to Vegas . It like going to an amusement park during some busy holiday weekend and crying about how you have to wait in line for a ride . It RIDICULOUS . Suck it up and wait . . the longer you wait the MORE food you will probbaly eat . HAHASo we waited like 10 - 15 minutes in line to eat dinner on Friday Night around 7 or 8pm . Normal wait time in Vegas without reservations can be at least an hour . it is a little bit pricey but again it worth it . Yeah it 34 . 99 and basically you pay $40 a person . In general the Bellagio is a NICE Casino and the buffet has nice decor . As soon as we sat down we were greeted and put our drink orders in . and then headed towards the buffet ! If you have not been to the Bellagio Buffet yet make sure you go around ONCE and look at everything they have to offer . The stuff on the right side is not always the same as the stuff on the left side so you wanna plan out what all you want to eat lol . The thing about Bellagio is that unless you are absolutely stuck on something in particular you could probably eat a whole bunch of different meals in one setting haha . My first stop is always the salad bar . They have freshly prepared salads to choose from and then they have the built - it - yourself . I love that their field greens are always fresh as well all of the other ingredients . They have got plenty of salad dressings and toppings . On to the stuff that everyone wants but rarely matters to me . Seafood ! There so much food in general that I basically ignore all the crab legs and other seafood . There is sushi available and it looks ok . I think I had it back in December and it was not anything to brag about . Bellagio seems to specialize in giving you different \"gourmet\" type foods . I especially loved the Kobe Beef Top Sirloin Beef Wellington Roasted Turkey and the Ostrich . Although I have never ate Ostrich I thought it was cool that they had it ! They also had roasted Quail . Did not try it but hey if you are adventurous do you ! Bellagio also has all of the staple foods that regular buffets have . Super creamy and fluffy mashed potatoes (& a pesto version) fresh artisan bread Asian cuisine pastas and carved meats . Deserts is where I think Bellagio sets itself from the Rio . Rio has a lot of selection as does Bellagio . But Bellagio cheesecake is legitimate . I think it plain cheesecake with a fruit topping is equivalent to cheesecake factory . The cheesecake itself is very rich and smooth . And they have other deserts as well . I ate a few different things but usually you are too full to even eat desert depending on who you are . All in all Bellagio to me is the best buffet in Las Vegas . I prefer it over any other buffet that I have been to and the service is great . They constantly filled up my drink took away my dishes and offered advice on food . I m sure there people that may disagree with me but ehh they are not as cool as me ! haha . Go to Bellagio and eat the buffet . Do not waste your money on a cheap buffet that gonna keep you on the toilet . Get quality & quantity here ! ',\n",
       " 'Holy happy hour specials Batman ! Bookmarked this place for their HH : 4 - 6PM half off tapas and $2 off wine or beer . Restaurant interior is more upscale than I expected . Menu is fairly diverse with vegan vegetarian and gluten - free options indicated with symbols . Tapas menu has several Mediterranean options there are a bunch of salads and of course there pizza - if you join their mailing list you will get a coupon to try a pizza for free (dine in only with purchase) . BF and I were here for a light early dinner got 3 tapas and a beer . FIG & GORGONZOLA FLATBREAD : Yum 4 - slice portion with good balance of flavors from the sweet figs salty cheese and mild spinach as well as a bit of pork? Adding a sprinkle of red pepper kicked it up a notch . PARMESAN STUFFED ARTICHOKES : Good lord these were the table favorite served in a blanket of parmesan crumbs with a cup of dipping sauce . Chokes had crunch and flavor herb coating was light and complemented the cheese inside which was mild instead of overpowering (as done elsewhere) . DUCK MINI TACOS : An order of 6 mini tacos filled with 24 - hour - marinated duck topped with cilantro tomatoes feta and sour cream HH pricing at just over $5? Amazeballs . I never would have combined duck and feta but I love them both and here everything worked so well together in this dish . Fresh and flavorful ! Only thing that detracted from my visit was the service : entered and stood by hostess stand for quite a while before being acknowledged and our server had way too many tables to herself and was quite frazzled . This was frustrating because there were easily 8 employees present but I guess maybe they were not on the clock yet? As 6 o clock got closer business picked up and the three women mobbing the hostess stand eventually started picking up the slack . Normally I would dock a star for this but despite being overwhelmed our server was polite and our food came out quickly and was amazing . Fabulous food phenomenal happy hour . Even with a beer total before tip was under $20 . Will be coming back to try more ! ',\n",

Looking over these photos and remembering how good these sandwiches tasted I would like to visit again soon but recalling how long my wait was and the negative vibes that bounced off the cook (that took my order) and another whom I thought was either an owner or a manager I am very hesitant on returning . :( I did enjoy the sandwiches especially the cheesesteak even though half - way through my half - sandwich I decided it was a little too salty . I thought the marinara on the parm a great contrast to the rich creaminess of the cheesesteak and kept me reaching for another bite of the eggplant ! Loved munching on the hefty wheat roll but I did not care much for the soft white roll that the parm rested on . ',\n",

I never foresaw coming to this church of Our Lord and Chef Yves Carreau a French transplant mastermind with a flair for the dramaturgic and a sense for artistry .

Those little personal pan pizzas are $4 and one of the only ways to get my pepperoni pizza fix without eating enough pizza for a small family and hating myself later . But the quality is lacking .

       " 'Let me start by saying that I do not drink coffee . If I were you my next question would be \"why is this person reviewing a café?\" and I would not blame you ! Le Caravane Café is a really nice place located on Lacombe on the corner of Gatineau right around the corner from Cote Des Neiges metro . Though I do not drink coffee I love any place that is open until 11 PM and serves food and excellent desserts . I do not know if the term exists but this place is basically the quadrifecta for me : open late check ; serves dessert check ; vegetarian food options check ; serves milkshakes ! ! ?? OK where do I sign? Please take my money ! Add to that the fact that the staff is always friendly and welcoming and i think they are starting to recognize me even though I have only been there a few times . This kind of personal touch goes a long way with me . Now to the important bits here are my recommendations for things not to be missed if you visit :The salted caramel and white chocolate chunk cookie is a classic crowd pleaser here and is well worth trying . The caramel saltiness is a perfect complement to the sweetness of the cookie and the white chocolate chunks . Your taste buds will thank you trust me . The White Chocolate Brownie Cake ! The White Chocolate Brownie Cake ! ! The White Chocolate Brownie Cake ! ! ! Oh My God ! ! ! ! ! Words cannot describe the decadence of this cake . When I first saw it I was drawn hypnotically to the words \"brownie\" and \"white chocolate\" but I ordered it with some trepidation because it looked like a cheesecake and I do not like cheesecake . I could not have been more wrong - what appeared to be cheese filling was actually a white chocolate mousse permeated with brownie bits ! Topped with a mini brownie and all of this on a base of brownie I think I died and went to heaven then I came back so I could do it all again ! Try a sandwich ! So far I have tried the grilled vegetables and the tuna and avocado and they were delicious ! I cannot wait to get there earlier enough someday to be able to get an Eggs Benedict that will be my next review . Have a smoothie ! There a choice of around 8 different fruits but do not be afraid to mix and match . My favourite is Banana Mango and Pineapple . I tried Banana Mango and Peach but it was a little too sweet (a part of me just died for saying that but it true) . Check out the bathroom (not in a weird way ! ) they have converted a bathtub into a planter with a few different trees I got a real kick out of that ! Le Caravane Café ! I cannot wait to go back !

I just ordered my usual two cheeseburgers Animal style without lettuce and tomatoes (http : bit . ly 2w4yKZl) . Just the way I like it and totally hit the spot for me . I did not order any fries only because I was craving the burgers at the time . This location is pretty similar to the San Francisco location at Fisherman Wharf . There no drive - thru but a ton of tables both inside and outside . Plus the prices are inflated since it literally on the Strip but still cheaper than Shake Shack and even White Castle .

       " 'There an interesting adage among men that goes \"sex is like pizza there no such thing as bad pizza . \" Well I m not going to ruminate on the former right now but the latter myth about the pizza has been completely debunked by Happys Pizza . I will start with the highlights . I was drawn into the store by an empty stomach with a pizza craving the \"neon light sign on acid\" Happys Pizza pizza parlor decor and the promise of a large specialty pizza for a mere $10 bucks approximately . It gets better . Three \"barely - legal\" young ladies happily welcomed me into the well - lit hiphop - music filled point - of - sale . These things are what earned my one star rating but sadly from there it was downhill . . . Barely after I entered my order paid and retreated to the window sill seating I noticed just how \"Happy\" the staff really was to be there . The counter staff immediately began texting loudly gossiping all their business and actually serving themselves soda in paper cups directly from the 2 - Liter customer cooler behind the register . I half expected them to put the half - drained 2 - liter bottle back in the cooler when they were done to keep it cool . My comfortable perch on the window sill allowed me to also observe the staff preparing the food . Things were not quite so festive back there . First of all the ethnic divide was stark and more than obvious . Trust me walking from the counter to the back seemed tantamount to walking into a different neighborhood or maybe even a different country . . . and they were consistently working . I was p ! $$@d for them so I could imagine how they felt . I was just hoping at this point that they were not taking it out on my pizza . Surprisingly the pizza was finished on time although I would not have known it if I was relying on the counter staff . I had to interrupt one of the girls who was on her cell phone when I realized the box that had been placed on the rack behind the counter had my name on it . Without interrupting her convo she handed me my dinner . . . she did give a big smile and mouth the words \"Thank You\" tho . Now for the food . I will make it quick . I will just say that the pizza was like nothing I have tasted before . . . not in a good way . The pizza sauce was a weird kind of sweet much sweeter than any I have ever tasted . . . makes me suspect ketchup and the crust was very bland . . . and I am a crust guy . I got a vegy specialty pizza and we will just say the veggies were nowhere near the level of let say a Dewey let alone a Papa John or other chain . They seemed canned . What should I expect from a $10 specialty pizza right? I could not eat more than one piece . I did not bother to take it back . For a second I was a bit worried about my unique name attached to this review and having to take on an alias if I ever went back to Happys then I had to check myself . . . I m never going to be going back to Happys . ',\n",

Another chicken strip restaurant in the game that I havnt been to so I took my wife and kids here because kids love chicken strips naturally . I ordered two 5 piece chicken strips meals ($9 . 29 each) . One grilled and one fried so we can taste both versions . Comes with fries and a drink . My oldest son wanted the Chicken Caesar Salad ($6 . 29) . The fried chicken strips were similar to Canes but a little bit bigger . The grilled were similar to Strip n Dip but twice as big . All strips were cooked just right and was not dry at all . The fries were a cross between shoe string and regular fries . It seems like they cut it fresh and fry it right away . I like these kind of fries because it has the skin on it still . The chicken caesar salad was good according to my sampling and the fact that my oldest finished it quick . PDQ has lots of nice features . Their two coke machines feature lots of flavors . The restaurant itself is a nice size to accommodate even the busiest of days . The condiment station has everything you need from ketchup to malt vinegar to napkins and utensils . They even have a separate hand washing station if that is all you need to do . The hand soap they provide for you has a nice lavender smell to it . It the kind of hand soap that you could probably find at a Bath and Body Works . Outside they have one of those bean bag tossing game thingies . Hours are everyday from 10 :30 am to 10 pm . There were two things that impressed me the most . Their customer service and the made from scratch sauces you can dip your strips in . The customer service was awesome . You order and wait at your table for them to bring it out to you . While we were eating they came by several times to make sure we were ok and that if we needed anything . As for the sauces you have your choice of bleu cheese buffalo bleu chipotle barbeque creamy garlic honey mustard ranch and sweet heat . You guys had me at garlic . What I like about it is because you can have as many sauces as you want for no extra charge ! I know all the other places charge you for any additional sauces . Overall I think the chicken strips are a cross between Canes and Strip n Dip but with better french fries . They also have chicken and turkey sandwiches along with hand spun shakes . Eventually I will try those items as well . Definitely will come back . Yelp 2015 Review #30528 overall',\n",

And at this place they throw it it your face as soon as you walk in . That fine . But bad service and ridiculous prices and an ugly wait staff force one to make you say \"why the hell did I ever go here?\" . The staff plays their parts well being total bitches . That fine . But if you do that than be fucking hot . Like porn star hot . And at the VERY least get the orders right and LISTEN to what we are paying almost 200 . 00 for . I could have easily played along had this waitress who I am doing a kindness keeping her name out of this review had gotten our order right taken the time to listen to a damn thing we said and delivered my friend his Sprite . I mean how long can it take to deliver a spite? I guess in this case of a totally inept wait staff who could not get a job at Denny the better part of two hours . The terms \"you are fired\" \"what kind of idiot am I to choose such a place\" and \"do not quit your day job\" come to mind . You are better off going to McDonalds . Embarrassing that this place exists inside a Las Vegas casino charging stupid prices . Never again . Had my fiancé not been in charge of the bill I would have walked out without paying a cent . Which was frankly MORE than this inept waitress deserved . Positive : The hats were funny . Fire your staff and start from scratch . Bitchy is a turn on folks . But only if they actually do their jobs and listen . Lucky I did not throw my drink in their faces . If you are stupid enough to ever go to this place you get what you deserve as I did . My mistake .

I should have known this would be a disaster if Guy Fieri has been here . When is his 15 minutes up? Every time I go somewhere that Guy Fieri has featured on Diners Drive - Ins and Dives it always turns out to be one of the worst places I have ever been . Guy Fieri knows as much about food as McDonalds does . First I did not even get what I ordered They make a huge deal about how to order how about getting the order right? What they gave me could not have been more opposite to what I ordered . I ordered black beans and plain fried rice . They gave me refried beans and pork fried rice or some fried rice that was contaminated with a pseudo disgusting meat - like product . I ordered a jade red burrito they gave me something with slimy pork inside and I asked for a veggie quesadilla they gave me a quesadilla with gross fatty chicken and a horrible sauce . The bag was filled with grease even on the bottom of it . It made a bag from Five Guys look healthy . I guess for some it is a novelty to mix Asian and Mexican . If you really want to enjoy such fusion head to Vegas and try China Poblano the creation of Jose Andres .

I cannot live without a good dose of meat in me each week . . . wait what . . . . yeah so bearing that in mind when I came to Phoenix for this work trip I knew I wanted to have a steak and a nice glass of spicy red wine at some point and so we came here since it was right near the bar we were at earlier . As soon as we walked in I dug the place . The decor is pretty elaborate and it easily a million dollar design . Even the bathrooms look like spreads in design mags and with the high ceilings and intimate lighting it a home run visually . After waiting about oh 20 minutes we were seated at a table and we all perused the menu . There were quite a few goodies that looked yummy but my heart and stubborn mind was on steak and a medium rare one at that ! I also wanted to try a salad cuz I was starving and so I ordered the Caesar along with my Rib Eye . The Caesar was okay at best . It definitely skimped on the dressing so if you like your Caesar salad Caesary then maybe order a side of dressing as well . Then there the rib - eye . A magnificent looking piece of meat it was but what did they give me to devour it with? You guessed it a butter knife . Really?Really . What in the Backstreet Boy Hell kinda bullsh*t is that? I probably would not have given the tenderness factor a second thought had it not been for the struggle to cut it with the wrong utensil . And it was not an oversight either this is what they intentionally give you to tackle your dinner with . La - me . I enjoyed my meal and the steak was tasty but please do yourselves a favor and upgrade to steak knives because it not tender enough to slice a dull blade through . ',\n",

She gave me an odd look and then said \"Those are dried vegetables . They are not fresh vegetables . \" My response was \"Yes?\" She then told me again they were not fresh vegetables and she added \"I do not think you will like that . You should order something else . We have fish and . . . . \" and she gestured to other items on the separate non - main menu . I just got profiled because I m not Asian . I wo not like it ! ! I do not think she will like this 1 star review ! ! ! ! I looked over the menu some more and opted for the curry chicken . In a short time the curry chicken was brought . Note that since I did not say hot and sour soup a second time it was left off the order . In a few seconds she brought the small bowl of rice . They use plastic chopsticks and I have a difficult time with heavily sauced Chinese food and plastic . I should have gone to the car where I always keep a pair of wooden chopsticks but I put the plastic ones down and started using my fork . The server saw this and asked \"Do you want a spoon?\" My answer was a quiet but firm \"No ! \" In a few moments she came to the table with a small plastic spoon that looked like a child spoon . The chicken was OK . The sauce was heavy . There should be more curry flavor . This was my fourth time here (and last) and I have always gotten Singapore noodles and after the first time I have had to stress heavy on the curry . That was my mistake this time . I finished my meal paid crossed off the line for tip signed the charge and left . As you can tell the service experience was awful . But I would like this server to know that if she ever came to my restaurant I would not tell her she would not like the scrapple . ',\n",
       " '\"I cannot believe I drove so far for this place\" comes to mind when I recall my experience here . Excuse me to my pals who think this place is all that . I guess we all cannot have the same opinions ; we would just be robots . Maybe they had a bad day as in a really bad day - with the word really underlined twice . Problems with the kitchen problems with the service problems with the fact they are even open . The high point of this experience was waiting for my friend to show up I stopped at the second hand store next door and did not buy anything . At this point I do not care to remember what I ordered I just remember trying to order it a 6 of 7 and the waitress scoffed at me and asked if I was sure I wanted it that spicy . \"You can always make it hotter but cannot make it less spicy . \" I guess that was true because I gave in and ordered it a 5 . What I did not realize was that the waitress meant to say I ordered a 5 on a scale of 1 - 100 cause this did not have any spice at all . bleh . . . After a few bites I calmly explained that on a scale of 1 to 7 that my dish was more like a 0 no spice at all . Her response if you really must know she said sorry we just had a \"big order from a table of 6 people\" if you want the kitchen to re - make your order it will be about 30 minutes . Instead of waiting for 30 minutes I asked if she could bring me some thai chili peppers and some chili paste to add to my dish I would just take care of it myself instead ; she showed up with chili oil and soy sauce . : - Thanks I guess . I pushed through spiced up my dish to satisfaction and enjoyed the rest of my meal but mostly the conversation with my friend and not really the meal or the dining experience . My friends dish was pretty sub satisfactory to her and she asked the waitress to just take it back . The waitress did not seem to want to just take the dish from the table and leave it at that after insisting on making a new dish to replace the unsatisfactory dish about five times . Instead of just returning the dish she gave in to the waitress and selected something different . While her replacement dish was better but not awesome she ended up getting charged for the replacement dish she did not really want to begin with . Given the choice next time I will aim for taco bell . Not exactly apples to apples in comparison but at least I wont have to spend a lot for crummy service and mediocre food . Happy Yelping Phoenix .

As it turned out dinner was the better option so I started checking on Yelp for places in Henderson where the group was spending the night . Il Chianti jumped out for its good reviews and I bookmarked the restaurant and I m so glad I did . I met my friend where the group was staying on Boulder Highway and Il Chianti was a mere mile and a half away . Il Chianti is in a non - descript small strip mall that I have driven by many times on the freeway but never on the Horizon Ridge side . We arrived close to eight and were seated promptly . While looking at the menu the chef owner came by to welcome us to this small restaurant that was dimly lit . We were told two specials and then we both ordered the lobster ravioli with blackened shrimp asparagus in a tomato vodka sauce . The shrimp were very good . Some of the lobster flavor was overwhelmed by the sauce but the ravioli were good . My friend is not a fan of asparagus and there was no problem substituting a different vegetable for her . For dessert we shared an order of cannoli . I asked our server if they were pre - filled or filled to order and she said they were filled to order . They were very good . Service was very good the staff was very nice and it turned out to be a good choice for dinner . Yelp comes through yet again . ',\n",
       " 'While visiting friends in Sun Prairie Madison I got dragged to Chicken Lips . Not until I arrived did I realize that I surprisingly had the joint bookmarked - - - solely off of the stellar Yelp reviews causing it to pop up as one of Madison best . *embarrassed*Chicken Lips is literally just a minute or so drive outside of Sun Prairie downtown on the side of a road among cornfields . I do not know if I would consider it a restaurant . It more of a bar run out of a dude (named Steve) first floor of his two - story house . Think \"Man Cave\" or \"Bachelor Pad\" lacking any luxury where \"boys can be boys . \" There are TVs a pool table arcade games a side door that opens up to a tent for smokers some nasty piss - ridden bathrooms . If only Diners Drive - ins & Dives actually visited true dives this is what I would picture except they only specialize in chicken wings not much else . . . There a bulletin menu at the bar which is where you also order . As someone who is not a fan of spice and on a non - fried food cleanse diet I became that guy that the neighboring table of 30 - somethings picked on . They kept reminding me while in their drunk stupor \"You gotta get the wings . \" I still ended up ordering a burger which was not very enjoyable and overcooked . Nonetheless the rest of my party ordered the infamous Wings . You get your choice of Dry Rub (what it all about : http : www . yelp . com biz_photos chicken - lips - sun - prairie?select = xOFL05ID2XQU28ycv_wtzQ#NgrDOJ2ui4MlKh1 - IVnOYg) or Original \"Buffalo\" wings . Both come with a tasty side of homemade blue cheese dressing dip . I could eat the entire cup of dip with just carrots and celery simple due to the fact that is has chunks of blue cheese hidden up in there ! Of course I reminded myself \"When in Sun Prairie do as a Wisconsiner would\" and bit into each type of wing . Without the dressing the dry wings were admittedly the best wings I have ever had - - - freshly fried full of meat and extremely tasty . Ca not say I would be back if so it would definitely be take - out since I m too prissy for a dive like this . I will concur the word on the street is right they cook up some killer chicken wings ! Note : Before you leave be sure to take a moment to absorb the glory of the bar and grill name \"CHICKEN LIPS\" and the light - up sign picturing a rooster holding a martini : http : www . yelp . com biz_photos chicken - lips - sun - prairie?select = xOFL05ID2XQU28ycv_wtzQ#xOFL05ID2XQU28ycv_wtzQ .

       " 'This used to be our late night Chinese spot and by late night I mean after Noodle Exchange across the hallway closes because the Exchange is a tastier experience . However we stopped going because the food started to make our bellies feel a little unhappy . We could never identify why exactly but we decided to relocate our late night Chinese adventures to Spring Mountain Road . However last night we happened to be booking up Flamingo and decided to give it another chance because for several months straight I had a serious Wrinkled Green Bean addiction and I wanted to go back for another round . I knew immediately I would be ordering the Wrinkled Green Beans with some extra wrinkles and I also ordered some basic chicken soft noodles . The service was a little slow but friendly . Our waiter smiled when I told him I liked them \"really wrinkly . \" My husband ordered a noodle soup . The green beans had a nice flavor but they were pretty greasy and some of the magic flavor (described as a Chinese tarragon) was missing . The noodles were brown from soy sauce which is not my preference . Plus the noodles lacked the amount of veggies that you often get in a noodle dish . A few slivers of cabbage some hidden bean sprouts but no carrots . And the noodles were a bit chewy . The noodles were no comparison to the same dish at Noodle Exchange just across the way . Everything just seemed a tad too heavy and my husband was not in love with his soup . He said \"It was not bad . \"I may be willing to go back for dim sum as I have yet to try that but for other times I am afraid last night reminded me why we had stopped visiting . ',\n",

They have a very unique menu that is half Mexican and Asian - Fusion in my opinion some of the best food combinations have been made this way ! If it your first visit be sure to hit up the sample area where they will sample you a number of their most popular items it totally worth it because it will definitely help you on what to order because there is soo many awesome choices it hard to figure out what ones to get ! They offer combo plates that come with your choice of items . When I visit I must get a Jade Chicken quesadilla it pretty much orange chicken inside a quesadilla but oh sooo good ! For the rest of my meal I had to get their amazing black beans they are sweet and just all around good ! The jerk fried rice was also over the top had a great amount of the jerk flavor with some chicken in it ! For the other half of my meal I ordered a carnitas burrito which was also really good and went very well with the delicious salsa they had up front ! If that were not enough food they also give you a cookie with your meal generally it will be snicker doodle but on the weekends they do offer another choice on the particular Saturday we were here it was a chocolate fudge cookie ! We definitely will be back here soon I hope as this is one of the best places you will find in Phoenix and a must bookmark for any Yelper who enjoys good food that full of flavor ! ',\n",

The seafood though is fire and I love the packages they offer I think if they can work on these things like their side dishes they will be a force to be reckon with .

No seating available . Came in seeking something unique . Found it in the oddball paletas section : tamarind ! Sweet but not cloying 80 calories for the entire thing and frozen rock - hard : I m pretty sure their freezers are set at way too low a temperature because I nearly a chipped a tooth on my treat and had to set it out on the counter for 10 minutes before I could gnaw off a shard to try .

We were impressed with the restaurant concept high end delectable fare operated as a one - man show . The starter white bean soup was bland and the main meal was very very spicy . It took about 3 hours to get through only three courses ; it was BYOB unfortunately the owner chef charged us a corking fee . We were not able to choose what we wanted for dinner we only noted any food allergies we may have had and the chef prepared surprise spicy beef dishes . When making the reservation the owner chef waiter offered to make a special birthday treat and asked my boyfriend what my favorite dessert was . He told him that I love cupcakes and Chef said he would make them for us . At the end of our meal he informed us that he had sold all of my cupcakes . That was absolutely positively 100% unacceptable . I do understand why it took so long to prepare and serve the meals but just that he sold out all of my birthday cupcakes not even just saving one for the birthday girl was disappointing .

Fancy Franks is a hot dog joint which also specializes in mini doughnuts (WTF AM I IN HEAVEN ! ! ?) while I did not try the doughnuts today I did get to try two of their hot dogs their fries and even got a cute little fountain drink ! This is definitely more of a lunch style place with large bar seating (TIP : I really wish you would install coat hooks underneath) . The decor is I m going to go with hot - dog chic as one wall is covered in vintage hot - dog pics and there is an old school counter where your toppings are added . They even have glass bottle pop (YAY ! ) but it is Pepsi (BOO ! ) . After taking a look at their wall menu and then discovering their much easier to read paper menu we ordered the California one (90210 something) and the pulled pork one (Southern something - obviously I m good with names) . You can choose between frank and sausage as well as a variety of toppings and whole wheat or white buns . The southern frank was SO good - topped with pulled pork and delicious slaw you cannot really go wrong . The California one was good but was a little dry (TIP : avocado salsa instead of avocado ! ) . The fries come in a huge portion (definitely split - able) and were salty and delicious . One thing to note is that I did not see a veggie option - not super surprising at a hot dog restaurant but just a tip ! With 10 - 12 more hotdogs to try as well as the mini doughnuts and considering this is walking distance from work - Fancy Franks I will be seeing you ! ',\n",

My bento box came with some sushi and sashimi . I m the type of person that does not like certain sushi selections so at a place where you order via waitress there is no problem with make substitutions . At a place like Spring Sushi you cannot do this because there is not a waitress to take your order . For the price I paid I could have gone to a cleaner better serviced sushi joint on the Danforth where I also get ice cream for free . . . and I pay about $2 less for the same items - if not more in my box .

Our school is close to El Paso and BBQ sounded filling for lunch . We do not get to leave for lunch during the school year so it kind of a last chance deal . We were greeted by a host who had a nice calm style and quickly seated us . The smell of smoked meats had me the minute we walked in . I am a sucker for the smell of smoked meat . My previous dining experience had been terrible here but I was reassured by the great host and the fabulous smell that this might be a better meal than last time . Waitress was courteous speedy and did not mess around trying to be overly friendly which I liked . She promptly brought us our drinks and corn bread muffins which tasted nice according to my friend . I ordered the Brisket lunch which came with my choice of two sides . There were many choices but I settles on coleslaw and sweet potatoes fries . The portion of the brisket was way more than enough served with a sweet BBQ sauce . Lots of good taste . Not earth shaking but solid and worth the money . Coleslaw was the way I like it not to greasy lightly sweet and crunchy . The sweet potato fries were a nice extra not highly seasoned but not greasy either . They were a good accompaniment to the sweetness of the sauce . My friend had the turkey wrap which looked great and was grilled interesting . . . While this is not the best BBQ in the city the strong points may be the good fast lunchtime service I experienced today . The food was tasty and not expensive considering the time it takes to smoke and cook brisket . Great place to take mom and dad for BBQ or the family after church on Sunday . Grandma nd Grandpa will love it ! Considering its proximity to a Super Target and my work I can see it being a place totake the family for dinner when I have a busy day and have to go back to school at night for meetings .

Only difference is this particular outlet mall in Las Vegas is Mega Huge ! ! ! ! Therefore this outlet mall probably has more stores then your average outlet mall . . . . . . . . . . . If you are not into shopping this mall still has a purpose . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . as you can walk this huge mall for exercise ! A nice feature about the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet is that this mall is an \"indoor mall\" so in the hot summers you wo not have to worry about the extreme Las Vegas heat and in the winter you wo not have to worry about the cold weather either . There are tons of stores in this mall as well as two food courts . Some of my favorite stores I like to check out are - Nike Under Armour Quiksilver Converse & Vans . The list of stores at this outlet mall are pretty endless . . . . . . . . too many stores to mention here so I will just post a link so you can see the various stores & eateries at this outlet mall . http : www . premiumoutlets . com outlet las - vegas - south storesIf for some reason you do not have a car to get to the Las Vegas South Premium Outlet mall no need to fret as there is a smaller version of this outlet mall near the downtown Las Vegas area called - the Las Vegas North Premium Outlet . The North Premium Outlet may not be as big or have as much stores but if you just happen to stay at a hotel in the downtown area like - the California Hotel Fremont Four Queens Golden Nugget Main Street The D Plaza Hotel or Downtown Grand Hotel the North Premium Outlet Mall is not too far away from these downtown hotels . . . . . . . . . . .

Since my wife loved Eggs Benedict we stopped off one sunday morning at 9 am to check it out . The menus they give you have breakfast on one side and lunch on the other . You can order anything on either side at any time . So my wifey went with the Eggs Benedict ($8 . 95) my son went with the Club Sandwich ($8 . 95) and I went with the Barbeque Bacon Burger ($8 . 50) . The Eggs Benedict were ok . Nothing really wowed me about it and my wife agreed . The Club Sandwich on sourdough was not bad either . My son said he has had better Club Sandwiches at least two other places . As for my Barbeque Bacon Burger it was on point meaning that it was really good . You get a half pound patty cooked to your liking (I got it medium rare which they cooked perfect) lettuce tomatoes barbeque sauce and of course bacon . It was a very good burger . Matter of fact I was not hungry again until dinner time that evening . Service was hit and miss . We got sat down right away . Got our orders in a timely manner and refills on water were constant . What bothered me was that when I asked for the check our server said she would be right back with it . 10 minutes later we havent heard from her . So we decided to go straight to the cash register to pay . Overall for a breakfast joint everything seemed to average out to about 9 to 10 bucks a plate .

First let talk about the wine list - amazing - extensive and somehow the waiters here really know the \"ins and outs\" of the wines . Our first bottle was a really fantastic Pinot Noir from Cali ($36) - nice choice John ! I chose the second one a Chilean Cab ($36) which was equally as rockin - nice choice me ! I left with a new appreciation for wine . We each made sure to get something different so we could taste each other dishes . My starter was the St Louis style ribs served with house made bread and butter pickles - whoa baby - I could have eaten a full rack - for a non BBQ place - they nailed them ! The shrimp heirloom tomato and charcuterie starters were all good ! My filet was a perfect medium rare - whoever works the meat station here is the man ! The deconstructed Salted Caramel cheesecake was pure melt in your mouth silky creamy goodness - loved the homemade crust as a cookie served on the side . Our waiter Kerry was a supreme gentleman with a great sense of humor . We were part of the last seating for the evening so we really got to take our time and enjoy ourselves ! ',\n",
       " 'This Chili located just off of Tyvola near the 77 exits is about 200 yards from my office (I know you are looking at my profile picture and thinking I spend my days dangling from a pole covered in glitter at The Men Club but alas I am just an office drone) so it is a frequent spot for quick lunches or takeout . It a Chili . It has Chili food and Chili service . Sometimes we can get in and out in 45 minutes other times it takes 45 minutes to get a salad . Because it is one of the few lunch spots in the area you can expect a wait at peak times . I do appreciate the online ordering so I do not have to talk to a human and explain my preference for no tomatoes no onions extra blue cheese I want ranch instead of honey mustard blah blah . When ordering stuff online you have a door register dedicated to takeout in the back instead of battling around the bar folks to pick up your food . I have always found food to - go to be fine . The folks are friendly . My order is typically correct . It Chili *shrug . ',\n",
       " 'When you are at a convention you do convention things . The All - American Bar & Grille had a revised menu to reflect Star Trek inspired dishes . We decided to check them out . We ordered the pulled pork sliders off the regular menu and the Bajoran hasperat . The sliders bread was good and the pulled pork as well . Nothing spectacular but good . We really enjoyed the hasperat (it like a vegetable wrap) . The hummus had a lot of kick ! Inside were julinenne fresh vegetables . You could order the hasperat with a protein but I passed on that option . It was truly delightful after the series of heavy meals that Vegas usually offers . The steak fries were crisp and accompanied the dish perfectly . 3 . 5 stars upped to 4 . ',\n",
       " 'We are spoiled in Vegas with the numerous ramen spots there are . Yagyu Ramen is in a crazy busy two story building on a lot with parking that requires tactical driving skills . It also sits diagonally across Pho Kinh Doh . . . I just wanted to say that . Not too busy when we entered the restaurant however . Only the parking seemed to be a hassle . With the great reviews and star rating I think I expected greatness . Such was not the case . Only a couple downers . They forgot my sprite order and good no charge for it . And their menus were handwritten taped to the wall plus an actual menu to view choices . We were looking everywhere just to order . That called for a beer pitcher . We enjoyed their ramen soup anyway . Soup was not over salted . Noodles had good texture . Portions were average . The broth was not actually fatty gags tasting ! Thank goodness . And service was okay . I will keep it neutral . ',\n",
       " 'Came in today for Sunday dinner . Greeted and seated immediately at the table with the couch by the restrooms(one of my pet peeves ) . I feel like we did not get enough attention compare to the other tables our server had . I did come in work out clothes socks and slippers . But that should not explain the poor service . Ok let talk about it - got seated and they dropped off 2 water glasses with no ice and a vase of water . I guess they do not like their water cold here . So I asked if we can have ice with our water and he comes back with 1 glass of ice so my girl and I shared this one glass of ice water our whole dinner . So dinner . . We ordered : - New England fry - kurobota pork chops - scallops - asparagus - Mac n cheese - kids chicken & fries - garden mule (cocktail) - Brookie (dessert) - Dutch chocolate ice creamlet start with the New England fry . It was basically fried calamari and whole bellied clams . It was good but nothing spectacular . The batter did not adhere to the seafood well . We ordered a garden mule to share since we just went bar hopping last night . . one drink wo not hurt right? We were not very fond of it . she chugged it so she would not taste it lol . Entrees : Lady ordered scallops with cauliflower purée and greens . We both liked this dish . Seasoned well and plated beautifully . I had the kurobota pork chops which were pretty bland and it did not help that it was dry either . I had to ask for more sauce but even that took forever because our server was never around . the only good thing on that plate was the slaw but that not the reason I paid $27 . I was unhappy with my entree and match it with neglected service it was pretty much downhill . We also had Mac n cheese and asparagus as side items and both were pretty tasty . Dessert : Brookie brownie and cookie combo topped off with salted caramel chunk ice cream . Sounds good enough right? while the idea is good . . . the execution could have been better . the brook was a lil hard . I was expecting moist and soft . That salted caramel ice cream is to die for ! Best thing I had tonight other than our one & only glass of ice water . Our dinner was not crazy expensive but at that price point . . I would expect more attentive service and staff actually coming around more often checking on us filling our water . Instead of dropping off a pitcher & food and not see a server til check time . We live 16 miles away and drove here for disappointment . Happy Easter honey salt ! ',\n",
       " 'I understand your skepticism . I too was skeptical because ultimately there are only so many ways to put egg on bread . The bacon egg and cheese was kind of along those expected lines . Fried egg on a spectacular bioche with piles of perfectly crispy bacon and some spicy ketchup stuff : Among the best BEC I have ever had but still just an egg sandwich . However the Fairfax is the one that changed my life forever . I am a different person than I was before that sandwich and I can never go back ! It the most masterfully scrambled egg I have ever experienced and far beyond what I could imagine . It was like air . Or silk . Airy silk? Creamy airy silk . With amazon seasoning and herbs and chives and chipotle aoili or something and all on that baller brioche . A truly mind blowing eggsperience and worth the 20 minute wait in line ! PS : that fresh orange juice is no joke you have already waited for infinity to experience peak breakfast perfection so spring the extra five bucks to wash it down with straight luxury . ',\n",

Located less than a mile north of the artsy Roosevelt row and looks like one of those house - type cafes that I would like to live in . Not many seats and a menu small enough to fit on a 5x8 card but the important thing is that they serve jackfruit . Yes honey . Jackfruit - a special treat for folk who like variety in their vegetarian staples . 3 jackfruit sliders puleeeze ! They held the mayo for me and still the bitty sandwiches were moist . Purple cabbage was crisp . Bread was lightly dry - toasted and soft . Perfect amount of fries fried with skin on and not overly salted . Will come again . Sho nuff ! ',\n",
       " 'Got an order of 1 2 rack ribs and two shredded pork shoulder sandwiches . The price felt a little steep at $31 before tip . However good BBQ is hard to find in this town and these meats are worth the price tag . The Ribs had a crispy skin and the meat was seasoned through and through fall of the bone tender . They really excels with their highly addictive sauce and the blend used to coat the ribs is truly a winner . There a nice mix of peppery BBQ sauce coating bits of onion and cooked - in sauce flavor that makes for thoroughly flavorful pork . The sandwiches are served dry with the sauce on the side . It tempting not to dunk your entire sandwich in it not because it dry but because the sauce compliments the meat so well . You get to choose two sides which were aplenty . The dinner bun that came with the rib plate was unremarkable as are the sandwich buns . But really you do not come here for the bread . Their dining area closes 1 2 hour before closing time so make sure you have ample time to indulge ! ',\n",
       " 'Gyeeeeeah Im a fan . . . . This place is better than eating fast foods . . I normally order their Broccoli cheddar soup for my mom . It quick and easy in and out of cheap sandwiches and cheap eats . . If i had to order something here I would normally order the cold cut combo on wheat bread toasted with cheese . . All I have to say is it get the stomach full . . Nothing too fancy like firehouse subs but get the job done to satisfy your hunger and it somewhat healthy . Like I said its better than eating Mc Donald or any other fast food places . . and their lettuce and veggies and meats are pretty fresh as well cannot really complain . . ',\n",
       " 'I will try it again but when I went it was the bare minimum no more no less . I liked the taste of everything except for the pink pickled turnips which I usually like but this time they were too pickled? The flavour was off somehow . Even my colleague who ordered a donair pita thought it was mediocre . Before we ate he said he likes that the brush the pitas with some garlic oil or garlic butter and then they press grill it in the Panini machine . He said sometimes it really good but maybe it was just the girls that made our food that day . The staff seemed unenthusiastic bored again the bare minimum . No extra flair here ! I ordered a donair salad . It was a very small serving . The ingredients were mediocre not outstanding . Canned pre - sliced black olives . Iceberg lettuce . The sauces we are OK . Not bad .

       " 'I have to agree with others that the owners are really nice people who are completely hands on and involved with getting a good cup of fruit juice or boba tea . This place is outside central GTA so it not convenient to most but for those in northern Brampton this is a great spot . The place is clean sparse and take out focused . In addition to the typical milk and green tea blends you do have the choice of pureed juices or even vegetable based ones . I decided to verve from my usual favourite black milk teas and go all in for the fruit . For only a $1 more than a large milk tea I got large scoops of fresh mango and sour sop fruit blended up with a touch of condensed milk and then a nice big scoop of bubbles to go with it . I would say my fruit drink was good . . . not watery at all and they kept the ice to a minimum so it was filled with more fruit . I did feel the boba was a bit mushy so a touch over cooked but the fact I can get a big nice fruit drink for only $1 more is a great steal . I think with the kind owners and great drink everyone living beside the cow fields in Northern Brampton has a wonderful spot for boba drinks and juices (healthy or not ! )',\n",

THERE you are . . With a serving spoon found the very few pieces of chicken . (Embarrassed at the poor impression they were making in this namesake dish they were all hiding underneath . ) The Focal Points . The Stars of this dish . The Main Ingredients . What this is NAMED after - - - or so I would always thought . Shocking how little chicken was present - - - much less than the equivalent of a very small breast . Not nearly enough for even two toddler appetites . This was as close to a vegetarian dish as I have ever had without specifically ordering vegetarian . Vegetables were fresh and flavorful . . . sauce quite delicious with just the right amount of heat . . . but more like KUNG PAO GREEN PEPPER with a chicken garnish . Called King Wah . Now you have to understand what I m like . I very rarely complain and if I do it legitimate and not over something trivial I m calm friendly and never raise my voice . I have made mistakes in my own kitchen and understand how things can happen . I explained the issue said how good it was otherwise and must surely have been an oversight . The man said no problem - - - the next time I was in I would get a half order at no charge . At that a woman suddenly commandeers the phone wanting to know what the problem was . I started all over again . . . was interrupted a \"few\" times . We went back and forth . The woman INSISTED that there was \"a lot of chicken\" in it and that she packed it herself (repeated this at least three times . ) I asked her what the normal amount would be . She had no answer - - - said she is not the chef but wanted to show him so he did not make the mistake with other orders . One time she said she saw all the chicken on the top then another that it all was on the bottom . (It was all on the bottom . ) An absolutely ridiculous conversation . I told her this dish - - - of many Chinese chicken dishes I have ever had - - - had the least amount of chicken I would ever seen . \"Just bring it back . \" That stubborn type who just refuses to believe concede apologize no matter what or no matter who on the other end . Okay . . . this is a stretch . . . but if this woman was alerted that she has a call from the White House itself and our Commander in Chief . . . go with me on this . . . in the same mellow manner - - - as I tried my best to maintain - - - he brings the very meager quantity to her attention and she quickly says \"MR . PRESIDENT there was a LOT of chicken in it ! A LOT of chicken ! I packed it MYSELF Mr . President ! \" Just one of those people who dig in their heels and never back off no matter how senseless . She told me to bring it back for a refund . I said I was not going back out tonight . Then bring it back tomorrow . I said that I probably could not . Or the day after she said to show the chef (?) - - - to put it in the refrigerator until then . Back and forth . I m getting a headache just writing this and rather than giving one to you let me put us both out of our misery by saying my Take - Out will soon be Take - Back .

Go figure that on a Saturday night the place was packed and we were told by the hostess and by our waiter that they were short staffed .

Loaded with feta cheese anchovies and lots more stuff than lettuce she said it was fresh and crisp and very tasty . The included pita bread slices were excellent . Having checked the reviews I opted for the chicken souvlaki . Lots and lots of chicken a great salad and a big pile of tasty fries . Yum ! Pastry counter looked awesome . Cheese danishes . Cinnamon horns . Cherry turnovers . Wow ! Very inexpensive meal and once the crowd was clear the service was great . ',\n",

It was fresh and had plenty of baby persian cucumbers feta cheese olives red onions tomatoes and pepperoncini . It came already dressed in just the right amount of house dressing .

The crust was nice but the filling was bizarre . . . the cumin was overpowering and the dried currants were a strange addition . . . like tiny little raisins . I cannot recommend this dish at all . The best part of the meal should have been the messy sundae . Unfortunately the ice cream was freezer - burned and hard as a rock . Food took foooreverrrrrr to come out .

So I went for her . Well it was a Saturday night and right around dinner time . We were seated right away in a booth (just want we wanted) we were greeted and taken care of immediately by the nicest waiter . Who I am so sorry to say I do not remember his name .

Fortunately it only took 30 - 40 mins to get to the front . - Limited seating area tables . - Menu is a bit finite .

I was pleased where it was because the bar area was very loud with music and conversation from the happy hour crowd . The hostess took me to the second of two dining room areas from the bar . The sound here was still lively but it was a more sedate area . A server came and took my order for an iced tea and it was brought quickly . I had looked at the menu online so I knew what my order would be . I opted for the lobster chowder - - the star of the meal - - the 16 ounce Niman Ranch New York and French fries for a side . The lobster chowder was excellent . The bowl as extremely hot The chowder had pieces of lobster on top and throughout and the broth was rich . There were also small cubed potatoes corn and bacon pieces . I would get this again . After a good amount of time my steak was brought . There was no discernible seasoning on the steak and I had to salt it . While I use a large amount of salt I rarely need to salt steak . The steak was very rare - - I ordered it blue so I was pleased that it was not overcooked . The amount of fries was a bit surprising because sides are where steakhouses go crazy with large portions . This was more like a serving of fries in a burger joint . It also came with dill ketchup . I am not a user of ketchup but I tried it to see what difference the dill made . Where the dill to paraphrase a burger commercial of years ago . Dessert was their chocolate pistachio soufflé . The server said it would only be a short time which was surprising because there had been no notice on the menu of the soufflé taking extra time . I imagine they pre - make and quickly bake the soufflé because it was out in about 10 minutes . The soufflé is chocolate into which the server pours the pistachio crème Anglaise . The flavors were good but the soufflé was not as light and airy as others I have had and I attribute it to the pre - made idea . Sevrice was very good . My iced tea glass was replaced with a fresh one as soon as it was near empty . The room is pleasant with a lot of crystal . The meal was OK but certainly not worth the price . It was Strip pricing and the chef needs to season steaks some . Green Valley Ranch is a distance away from where I live . When I eat there in the future it will be at one of the other restaurants .

Great flavors like Cheetos hummus fried chicken wings baklava salted caramel and many others . The man behind the counter asked us how we heard about this place on Yelp where else? After serving a few more people that came in after us he let us try one of the secret flavors in the fridge . Cheetos really tasted like Cheetos . All of these selections made by Pastry Chef Desyree . A great imagination turned into different gelatos and sorbettos which you can also order cakes in these flavors . That would be something else to have your guests try to figure out what flavor cake they are having when it fried chicken wings or baklava . I had the dark chocolate and the basil sorbetto in the same cup . The combination was a great match . It was like a dark chocolate you would have in a candy bar .

       " 'I hate writing about a negative experience . Sometimes experiences just stinks . . . literally . Food was pretty good and service was good as well . What was pretty terrible was the atmosphere . The smell that rose from the bathrooms and into the dining area was like the sewage system of Queen St deciding sit among the dining tables . It was pretty awful that we ran as fast as we could after eating super quick . I do not think we stayed more than 30 minutes here . This is a pretty small restaurant and we arrived when it first opened for Sunday brunch . I have read great reviews on how it the best spot on Queen St W for brunch and I have also been to Lasa and loved it . Our first experience was opening the doors and stepping into the smell . It was over powering . They had not open the doors to the outside quite yet so the smell just hanged around like a bad ex (or a terrible metaphor) . Service here was pretty quick and took our order quite quickly (thank god) . We had a french toast the Ensaladang Talong (grilled eggplant salad) and an OJ . The bench seats werent too comfortable in the back seating area but I was not expecting to lounge here too long . French Toast - With housemade brioche this was a super rich and indulgent brunch dish . The custard went through completely and made it more like a very moist cake . The butter hits your tongue last as you enjoy the flavours of it . The calamansi was a nice needed tart citrus that just cut through the richness of the brioche dulce de leche and ube flan . The ube flan was a nice visual contrast as well . 4 5Ensaladang Talong - Using the Asian skinny eggplants they grilled them till tender and drizzled a sweetened soy that reminds me of kecap manis . It was really nice and the small salad added on top was a nice addition but certainly could have been more . Most of the plate was left empty to accommodate the single poached egg . The egg was really well done as it nicely oozed the yolk onto the eggplant and coasted the garlic rice that I added to the dish . Personally I would have loved more vegetables instead of the huge generous portion of garlic rice . The rice was tasty but I didnt need the large bowl of it . 3 . 5 5Orange Juice - I normally wo not rate OJ . . . especially bottled ones but they were charging $4 for the small glass that was poured straight out of the bottle . It a little steep . We could have bought a 2L tropicana for that . 2 5Overall I wish we enjoyed our time here but between the smell and the OJ . . . it just didnt give us the right vibe to rate it a 4 star and a return visit .

Even though I had plenty of time to stand in line and eat I decided to just grab a turkey wrap from the cashier . The tortilla portion of my wrap was hard around the edges so I ended up just dipping the turkey meat into some mustard disappointed . When my car was finally ready (almost 20 min after the estimated time) I naturally handed the guy a large tip when he handed over my keys . Note to self : do not tip until you see if the job was performed well . I hopped in and drove away it did not take long for me to realize my car was still dirty . I lifted the floor mats and there was still sand dirt random stuff under the mats . The backseat had white all over it from the polishing cream and there was still dust all over my dash . If I wanted a sloppy job done I would have cleaned my car myself . But I came to professionals to have it done correctly . The only good thing was the outside of my car looked great . But any $3 car wash could pull that off my car was not that dirty on the outside to begin with . Based on this experience I will not be back . Nor can I continue to recommend this place to friends . What a shame . ',\n",

       " 'Let me begin with the food . HORRIBLE . My date asked the waiter to give her the most popular dish on the menu . He comes back with a Leg of Lamb . My date is 115 lbs . and the leg was the size of a basketball . Was he serious? I dont believe this big leg of lamb is the most popular dish for women . It tasted like a dead carcass . We took one bite of the leg and did not eat it . They did not bother to ask if anything was wrong or offered to take it off the bill . You can obviously tell my date is upset and yet they ignored her and sent us the check . The service here is atrocious . We took that leg and tried to feed it to my pitbull . She sniffed it a couple times and walked away . Goes to show their food cannot even get a hungry dog to take a bite . Avoid this place like the plague . ',\n",

The place smelled like a three inch road trip inside the lower colon of sick deer . Every employee with whom I spoke had apparently awoken on the wrong side of the bed . Not a smile to be found . And my lettuce was rotten wilted and brown . That is inexcusable in a restaurant and surprising to encounter at a national franchise . Who in charge here? Makes me wonder whether the meat is beyond its expiration date too . Stick with the guys whose door is propped open with customers waiting to get in . An empty restaurant like Qdoba speaks for itself . ',\n",

I love Hawaiian food so I bookmarked it knowing I was going in December . Fast forward a few months and I m in Hawaiian Heaven . Here the run down :Fried Mac N Cheese Balls - a good starter . It was fried perfectly and the mac n cheese was so creamy inside . It was cheap too . $2 . 45 for 4 big pieces . Delicious We came here for the Poke we got :Shoyu Ahi poke - my favorite Delicious . Ahi Furukake poke - it was still a bit frozen but still good . Spicy Ahi Combo w Crabs Avocados & Cucumber - my favorite 1A . DeliciousTako poke w Limu (seaweed) - octopus was super tender . The Ahi were big chunks of raw tuna . So fresh so good . You have got to try this place if you like poke . We also got some hot dishes . Loco Moco - we were all loco for this dish . The best loco moco I have ever had . The hamburger was just so flavorful and you get two big hand made patties . The gravy is just money . With two eggs & two scoops of rice . Oh man this alone made the trip here so worth it . Delicious . Must order here . Kalua Pig & Cabbage - another winner . Authentic Hawaiian dish . No fake smoke tender juicy goodness . Yum yum yum . Kalbi - Delicious fall off the bone tender and the marinade was spot on . Cooked to perfection . Delicious . Hilo Bay Bento Special - this had everything . A piece of spam pork cutlet pork teriyaki beef short rib noodles pickled radish and all on a bed of rice . This dish is a mouthful and everything was so so good . It a special so they might not have it everyday but if they do get it . You wo not regret it . The service was very friendly and helpful . We ordered a lot of food and kept adding to the order and the guy taking the order was very patient with us . The place is small . A few tables (for 2 only) line the wall . Get your food to go . I need a nap now after that luau we just had . Hawaiian food done right . Sandra thank you for the recommendation ! ! I will definitely be back',\n",
       " 'As I sit here eating chips and reflecting on my experience having my BIRTHDAY LUNCH at the new Sugar Factory I am forced to wonder what would ever possess any restaurant owner to decide that their only vegetarian dish should be a freaking fishy tasting soggy garden burger from a box . Also I wonder why I am so hungry after literally just paying for a nice meal?I have raved about the Sugar Factory veggie burger at the other location and I was beyond stoked that there would be a more easily accessible location at the Town Square . Finally a place to get these gourmet burgers that I m in love with ! I will never visit this location again because I am so mad that they ruined my birthday by serving me a lazy garden burger and then executing it poorly on top of that . I know that vegetarians are not the major focus in the business model but if you are going to bother putting anything on your menu that is for vegetarians you should make a half hearted effort to elevate it from the standard slop you can get at any bar or Denny for 1 3 of the price . Then calling it an \"Ultimate\" veggie burger? Please . It is insulting to serve that in a restaurant that you claim is \"gourmet\" . Let me be clear I understand that restaurants change their recipes and their menus . I totally get it . But this is not a menu change it is a bait and switch . You are promised an ultimate burger but you are given crap that is readily available in a supermarket for less than $2 . They did not cook it they heated it up . Infuriating . The server was very nice but inexperienced . No one found it suspicious that I did not eat my \"ultimate\" veggie burger . I m basically led to believe that this location is a cheap reproduction of the real thing and I am both starving and unimpressed . Afterthought : Our phones actually did not work while we were in here so I do not know if they block service with a jammer or if Town Square was just too crowded . . . however I do not think your phone not working enhances the meal or the experience . Maybe they should call that \"ultimate\" internet? Boo this place is an ultimate fail . ',\n",

Crispy tacos that are cracked right down the middle the second I unwrap them fish tacos on tortillas that are torn in multiple places and drowning in mayo?

Just that when you bite into a piece of teriyaki chicken on a stick it should generally taste like chicken (or at least a meat that tastes like chicken) . Doing so here tasted like well something else . In fact just about everything here tasted like something else . Again it was not that the food was bad or out - of - date or anything . It is just that everything - meat vegetables and even sauces - did not taste quite right . It quite possible that the taste buds in my mouth were off or something but a bite a short while later at the bakery was just fine . So my money is on the Lotus Buffet . You can draw your own conclusions . ',\n",

Plus owner Mark Tarbell came by our table to welcome and thanked us for coming in and as the night progressed I saw him do that with each table . That was a really nice touch and I have not experienced that type of service with any other restaurant in town . We tried 3 of the 4 bikinis on the menu and they were all delicious made with some of the best tasting bread I have had in awhile . Plus the portions are perfect to start and cut to sharable sizes that is if you do not eat it all first . I ordered the chicken street tacos for dinner . You get 3 large tacos which I really enjoyed but it was almost to much food for me enjoyed the salsa verde the comes on the side . We shared the coconut cream pie for dessert and let me tell you that it was the most amazing dessert I have ever had . I definitely recommend ordering it even if you do not think you could possibly eat anymore once you taste it you will be licking the plate clean . They are only open for dinner which is a shame because there are so many items on the menu that would be a great lunch . Definitely plan on going back to try the burger . ',\n",

I had seen this place on yelp and it was pretty highly rated and I had a cousin visiting from out of town so I thought pizza why not lets try Il Bosco ! We walked in the door and we were immediately greeted by \"we have no room\" from a white haired man named Bill (who I later deduced was the owner because he had his tweenage son working there as well) . Hi to you too ! Alas he found us some space at the bar . I set my things down at the bar and I happened to have a bottle of water with me that I did not want to leave to roast in the car because it Phoenix in July and that would be a waste . I had every intention of ordering a drink . He confiscated my bottle of water and placed it behind his counter looked at me like I was some sort of village idiot and asked me if I brought my own food in for him to cook too . I was dumbfounded . He only returned the water after my mom insisted she would put it away . After reviewing the menu I ordered the Elana pizza without salami as my cousins requested . Again I got the you are - an - idiot face from Bill and a \"you just want a pizza with olives?\" Why yes sir is that gonna be okay with you? I m freakin paying are not I? He did seem to be very friendly with customers that he knew or were regulars . Sorry you did not give us that chance . I was literally OVERWHELMED by the condescension . And then to add the icing on the cake he kept coming by to make sure everything was great and acted all reverent and friendly when we got done and were leaving . Its too freaking bad Bill . Because Brent(?) and Gerardo and even your son Max were all lovely human beings and the pizza was pretty good too . But if I wanna feel like an idiot I will take a calculus class not come to your pizza joint . Wont be returning . ',\n",
       " 'Not imperial Thai or even Americanized Thai . It Swanky Thai keeping the traditional flavors but replacing the primary ingredients with upend versions . It does not work . A Chilean sea bass is destroyed . It subtle oily flavor hammered by a fiery chili paste . Marinated Cornish hens with garlic so overpowering that only it shape and mouth feel let you know what is . Just the opposite using rib steak in the drunken noodles robs the dish of the beefy flavor and sinewy fatty texture that a humble cut of beef would bring . Thankfully there are more traditional dishes that really shine . The Pla Tod Yum Ta Krai (fried whole tilapia with lemongrass salad dried shrimp and cashew nuts) is excellent . The flesh of the fish overcooked and rubbery near the skin just as it should be . The slight muddy flavor enhanced by the dried shrimp perfumed by lemongrass and brightened by a lime chili and fish sauce drizzle . Lo - Ba (braised then fried pig ear tongue and heart served with fresh cucumber and \"sauce\") sounds disgusting . It well worth the try . Trust . Too adventurous the Moo Hong (Braised pork belly with black soy palm sugar and black pepper) or the Pou nim pad prik Thai (fried soft shell crab with soy garlic black pepper and green onion) both make for good eats . Large wine list with useless \"bragging rights\" labels . Good selection of Rieslings . Inexpensive . Efficient service . Small plates meant to be sampled and shared . Reasonably priced considering .

       " 'I saw the Heart Attack Grill on television and knew they had scantily clad nurses and lard induced food . What you do not realize is the restaurant is really going for more than the lard version of Hooters . They want to give you the feeling that you are eating in a strip club . By that I m not suggesting that the nurses are inappropriate or wearing too little clothing . It just that you walk in and they have long tables shaped like a bar with stools . It like a cheap inside joke they are TRYING to be the ultimate guys hangout : lard burgers and fries waitresses who are dressed like stripper nurses no veggies no diet coke all the lard drenched steak fries you can eat corona and regular coke served in bottles . Yeah I m fine with all of that and I understand this place is going for that theme . So in short the concept is fun but the execution is horrible . Here are the problems1 . Food : the burgers tasted as if they went to Food City and bought the cheapest meat they could buy and dump it in some lard . The lard did not not make the food taste any different with the exception that I felt really full and heavy at the end of my meal . The food was very disappointing . 2 . Scantilly clad women in nurses outfits are fine as long as the women wearing the outfits are attractive . That was not the case here . They are not even Hooters quality in terms of attractiveness . 3 . Yes I want greasy food but I do not want to feel like I m standing next to the fryer as I eat the food . The floor had so much grease that had condensed from the air that I almost slipped several times . The place had a bad odor and it just stank from the lard . You felt like you were eating in the kitchen . 4 . Lack of service : the nurses chat with you and are friendly but they do not serve you . It like Fudruckers . You get your own fries . You put toppings on your own burger . You fill out your own order check at the end . The waitress only takes your drink order and points to a wall and aks you to pick out a burger5 . Scary crowd : the people eating at the restaurant reminded me of people on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre . We are talking major rednecks here ! It was mostly middle aged guys sitting by themselves and eating as if they were at a strip club I also saw a bunch of kids eat here and they looked as if they running moonshine between Kentucky and Ohio in the 1920 . 6 . No credit cards . They have an ATM in the place if you lack cash7 . Expensive . I paid 14 dollars for a beer and a burger .

       " 'I can definitely say that this is my favorite buffet in Vegas actually since I do not like buffets it pretty much my favorite in general . My friends and I went to Vegas last month and went to the Bellagio for dinner . There was a vast variety of foods . There were crab legs prime rib asian section pasta section etc . Most of which (I would say all but I did not get to try everything) were really good . Since I have a sweet tooth if I ever go to a buffet I usually spend more time in the dessert section than anywhere else . They had so many choices in desserts ! And let me tell you the CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES are effin incredible . Their covered in like dark chocolate with mini rice balls sprinkled on top . I think they are the number one reason that I love Vegas . The service was awesome our waiter kept refilling our drinks each time we returned to the table it was cleared . Since I did not write a review last month about it because I honestly suck as a yelper I lag on reviews and I m just plain lazy . So now my updated review will be here as well . That being said we went to Vegas again last weekend ! This time we went to the Wynn for dinner (totally NOT better than the Bellagio people who have said it was is on crack) . Being kinda disappointed by the Wynn we went to the Bellagio for Sunday brunch . Again Bellagio did not disappoint at all . There was so much food to choose from . They had this herb - crusted prime rib that was soooooo good . It was so tender and juicy . Omg . Their pancakes with so fluffy it just melted in my mouth . I made my own version of strawberries stuffed french toast by getting strawberries form the fruit section and placing them in between two slices of freshly made french toast drizzle some syrup and dusted some powder sugar . Heaven . Heaven . Heaven . or Hell . Whichever you prefer as the better destination to be . They had no chocolate covered strawberries for their brunch . Sucks . And service this time kinda sucked our waitress would not refill our drinks unless she was flagged down and even then she would forget some of ours and we had to flag her again to remind her . And it would be kinda annoying because I would be too awkward and shy to ask again (since it would happen to be my drinks that she would forget like my orange juice refills and tea) . Our tables would not be cleared in fact some other waiter helped us clear it a couple of times . But then our waitress was limping so I felt kinda bad and let her slide and still tipped her pretty good even though my friends are pretty correct that if you are paying that much you should expect service comparable to that . Oh yeah ice cream was chocolate and vanilla soft serve . :( disappointing but not enough to knock off a star . Review was so long but really I can go on and on about food . ',\n",

To a place I have found the end resulted (1) expensive and (2) disappointing . That is true of JPH : nice Baristas but the end result was bitter watery with absolutely no redeeming flavor .

With their one of a kind handmade tables cups wooden plates artwork they really leave their mark as one of the coolest coffee houses in ClevelandYou really cannot go wrong with any of their food I am a big fan of their falafel and shawarma . Their hummus is also very good but a little tame for me I like my hummus more offensive with more lemon and a tad more garlic but that just a preference thing . Algebra is also very vegan friendly and has a large assortment of healthy menu options . Is not it a great feeling to finish a big meal and still feel healthy afterwards?Their drinks are not for the average venti - mocha - frappuccino - with - extra - whipped - cream coffee sippers . As is the food the drinks are authentic and are generally not too sweet if at all . If you are unsure of what to order I recommend the chai tea and perhaps the falafel sandwich as startersMy only gripe with this place is that they are not too consistent because they have a different person working there almost everyday all of whom have their own slight variations on food and drink prep so if you liked the chai tea you had Monday morning you might not like it as much Wednesday night . But this place delivers on so many other aspects that I cannot bring myself to give them anything below a as good as it gets So come check this place out order an iced chai tea with falafel sandwich you wo not be disappointed ! And remember on your way out it push not pull :)',\n",
       " 'I came for dinner before a concert at the Grand Garden . I was seated promptly in the back room rather than take a table at the bar . The whole place including this room are very dark with mirrors most notably running the length of the ceiling . My server brought a menu and a water glass was filled . The server stopped by again and asked about drinks and I ordered my usual iced tea which was soon brought . My dinner consisted of three tapas plates - - octopus ceviche with grapefruit and pickled jalapeño shrimp risotto with a tomato fondue and arugula and ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib and pea purée . For dessert I got the chocolate makeout - - a warm chocolate fondant with salted caramel cream peanut brittle and caramel sauce . The octopus ceviche was very good . The dish had a good citrus flavor from the grapefruit and the pickled jalapeños added a good contrast . Served with the dish was a small amount of corn chips which I ate along with the octopus . The shrimp risotto was OK . There was nothing special about the dish . The shrimp were large but the dish as a whole lacked any wow factor to make the whole standout . The shrimp were also a bit chewy . Last was the ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib and pea purée . I really liked this dish . The short rib was very tasty as opposed to the bland ricotta gnocchi and there was no discernible taste of the pea purée at all . Still I liked the flavor of the short rib and the softness of the gnocchi made a good fit . Dessert was the chocolate makeout - - almost a chocolate lava cake but mercifully not another rendition of this ubiquitous dessert . The chocolate fondant was rich and I could have piped the salted caramel cream directly into my mouth . The peanut brittle and small amount of caramel sauce added texture and flavor to the dessert . Service was varied . The iced tea was brought with no sugar or other sweeteners . When the server came by one time he stopped and then asked if I had wanted any sugar . I asked for some artificial sweetener which he never brought . After he went by a few times I stopped a busser and asked him and I had a container of sweeteners in no time at all . When it came time for dessert a different server stopped by and asked me if I wanted dessert . I ordered from her . After dinner the original server brought my check and took payment . The server did not ask if I needed anything explained from the menu nor did he mention more than one off menu special . The other server mention a couple of them to the tab ;e next to me and asked them if they had been to the restaurant before . She then went on to describe some of the dishes and told the people if there were any other questions to ask her . I think maybe she should have been with me the whole time . The bus persons were very efficient and removed finished plates in a timely manner . Crush is OK . Your paying Strip prices for some average food . ',\n",
       " 'I could not say that this is the best Shawarma in the city but what I can very well say is it my favourite . If this situation needs some gravity added to it well I would do terrible things terrible unspeakable things just to get my hand on one of these delicious flavourful and fresh wraps or even more terrible unspeakable thing if you got in the way of me enjoying them . Do not you mess with my shawarma man ! Well that got heavy real quick but for good reason ! Have you had one of these things? The chicken is moist flavourful very spiced and not overly greasy . What goes into a shawarma is kind of hard to explain . All of the ingredients are the same - chicken or beef your choice of lettuce tomato onion peppers those pickled purple dealies and your choice of hot and or garlic sauce (get them both ! Go ahead make your day punk ! ) all wrapped up in a pita . Simple right? But the way this tastes when put together at Jimmy A&A Deli is best described by Paul G . (1) review of Thi Thi Subs(2) - \"it like I just described the Eiffel tower in terms of its constituent steel beams . \" The numbers going into the shawarma equation are simple but the final output is inexplicable relying on art and possibly wizardry to create a concoction not achievable by science alone . The second party of this review? The people here are so lovely ! It a family owned business and from start to finish they make you feel like part of the family . The sign outside says \"Made with Love\" or some derivative of and oh heck yes it makes a difference . Is a blind taste test Jimmy Shawarma going to compare with another quality no name shawarma well I damn well think so but even if it did not the people are so awesome here that the authentic friendliness and overall care they put into their business and patron is enough to make we want to shop here everyday regardless of product .

       " 'When I think of Montreal Portuguese cuisine is not the first thought that comes to my mind . Smoked meat and poutine may be the dishes that Montreal may be best known for but you can add Portuguese Roast Chicken to that list . At Rotisserie Romados their Portuguese Roast Chicken is right up there with some of the best grilled chicken that I have eaten . How good was the chicken? This was by far the best meal of my trip ! Located in The Plateau neighborhood Rotisserie Romados is about an 8 - 10 minute walk from the Mont Royal Metro station . Upon first glance I honestly thought that the outside facade of the eatery reminded me of a church . That being said this \"church of chicken\" is a fairly small eatery with a few seats if you choose to eat in but primarily a place to order take out . Besides the roast chicken Rotisserie Romados also has a bakery that serves up a pretty respectable selection of mouth watering Portuguese pastries . As far as the food is concerned let just say that something is seriously wrong with you if you leave here hungry . Eager to feast on some chicken that I had heard so much about I ordered the 1 2 Chicken Plate that came with a salad and was covered with a mountain of fries . At only $8 CAD this was such a great deal especially with the portions being so generous . Grilled over charcoal the roast chicken was extremely moist on the inside but still retained a crispy crunch on the outside . Although the chicken was probably tasty enough as is I decided to have my chicken slathered with a spicy Piri Piri Sauce to get the full Portuguese Chicken experience since I had come all the way from Hawaii . The spices from the Piri Piri sauce and the drippings from the chicken were the perfect sauce to dip my fries in to scoop up all that yummy flavor . If this were not good enough the lady at the register also added in a free dessert to my lunch . This would be more than enough for most people but I always have room for dessert . I do not speak any French or Portuguese but I made sure to remember the words \"Pastel De Nata . \" This Portuguese Custard Tart was the perfect end to my chicken feast and just blew my mind by how creamy delicious it was . Just writing this review makes my mouth water and brings back fond memories of my trip to Montreal . ',\n",
       " 'What I like about this place is their menu does not have a million items on it like many Thai restaurants do . It also appears to be very clean and you can view the kitchen from the dining area . The service was also great . The dining area is small so I would think it fills up pretty quick at lunch and dinner time . The Pad Thai noodles were the best Pad Thai I have had so far . The yellow curry was good . They make it with white potatoes sweet potatoes peppers and onions . I ordered it 5 spicy and that was pretty hot . I might go for 2 next time . The curry was good but I still think Archie yellow curry is the best around Vegas . The roti with yellow curry I did not care for . Actually the curry was good . It was the bread that I did not care for . They use a flaky bread that is deep fried . I am use to having baked bread with my roti . I m sure it is good if you like fried bread it just not my thing . I will definitely be back for the Pad Thai . ',\n",

So you can imagine I was not thinking how delicious this might be or having the excitement of a fresh pie coming my way ! We tried The Chorizo it was so unique . It was like a street taco thin crust topped with cheese chorizo cilantro tomato raw red onion and a little radish . . it was an explosion of flavor . Just the perfect mix of hot food with crisp toppings and tiny amount of spice . Well balanced you just wanting to keep eating it to keep getting the wave of flavors . Local sourced ingredients friendly service + delicious product . And did I mention beer? They have a five or six local beers on tap . Good times .

       " 'I travel with a competitive speech team . We were recently in Arizona for a competition and my team HAD to stop at the Heart Attack Grill - a member of my team is doing a speech about it we could not get away without seeing the place firsthand ! Upon arrival we were immediately greeted by a smell that can accurately be described as \"Fat grease and charred death . \" You know the smell that sometimes comes out of a burger restaurant - the slightly - singed but otherwise - delicious smell of meat being grilled? This was a sick amplification of that . The smell alone was enough to drive several members of our party to pursue other options for dinner . As far as decor the restaurant does a good job of sticking to an anti - doctor theme with signs plastered all over the restaurant warning you of the unhealthy nature of their food mandatory patient gowns for all diners and waitresses dressed as cute nurses . But the food itself could be summed up with the word \"Sickening \" which actually works metaphorically and literally . Their shakes are incredibly sweet but actually filled with ice cream pure cream and butter . Their fries are cooked in lard and their burgers are excessively heavy and fattening . A burger and fries is really enough to fill up a fully - grown man but the sensation of being completely filled by lard meat and grease is almost as disgusting as seeing one of the obese regulars scarf down a triple - bypass burger for free . The next morning most of us who would eaten there were still full . One of my friends said he \"felt like [he] just blew the Hamburglar . \" Starting with the smell and lasting all the way to the aftertaste the next morning this anti - hospital is as novel as it is grotesque and excessive . I seriously almost threw up twice before I even tried anything but I like to exercise and eat healthy . Other people did not seem as disturbed by the place as I did and to HG credit the things they serve actually maintain a stronger semblance to edible food than some other places I have eaten . It will definitely fill you up and the theme is kind of cute . Nonetheless I cannot walk away from a restaurant feeling like I just destroyed my body and recommend it . I almost feel like the place is unethical for its choice to give such flagrantly unhealthy meals . At the same time the place is called HEART ATTACK Grill and they do not make any effort to pretend they are doing anything other than providing the most unhealthy and disgusting food possible . With that and the friendly service in mind I cannot justify any rating lower than 2 5 . I would definitely like this place more if they just used fresh ingredients did not cover everything in nastiness and just stuck to making good burgers fries and shakes . . . but I realized that would just make them In - N - Out and would kind of ruin everything this restaurant stands for . Disgusting? Yes . Necessary? No . Immoral? Decidedly no since they clearly warn you about what you are getting in to . I would eat here once and NEVER again . It a place fueled by novelty - go there only if you are inspired after watching Epic Meal Time on youtube . ',\n",

       " 'Had to rate this more severely because it was pretty expensive . I have been privileged to try many delicious omakase in the past that this experience was just at par . Managed to get a seat by the sushi bar and watch the itamae - san at work . Found the additional $25 sashimi presentation haphazardly plated . Not sure why but just felt it lacked heart because by omakase standards each piece would had been cut and placed 1 by 1 onto your plate wood block . Also would like to mention that the small rectangular plate should had been wiped of residual soy sauce to prevent flavour contamination that may ultimately change the flavour of the next piece of nigiri . But alas they did not do this . The quality of fish were quite fresh and it was nice to know where the fish came from . The tuna from Mexico I found out later was actually the Pacific Blue Fin Tuna which is an endangered species due to being over - fished with its population dropping 97% since last year . While it was nice I do not think I will ever have it again - - will choose more ethically sustainable fish carrying forward . Not sure if times have changed since last year but one must mention that there were several pieces broken pieces served - - sushi chefs in Japan would find it heart - wrenching because sushi is considered an art and the chef the artist . To serve guests flawed pieces of food means to taint one masterpiece which is not acceptable . Finally the big reason why I was met with disappointment was the fact I found thin piece of hair in the anago covered in the kabayaki sauce . Anyway emailed the establishment and was told it was from their marinating brush because their chefs wear hats . Yes while I am sure precautions may have been taken it does not eliminate the fact that it may have come from another source ; accidents do happen . In any event the hair was too long to be of that sort but I wo not contest . Do check your nigiri and bring it to the staff attention (or you will end up kicking yourself like me for not letting them know sooner . )All that to say Yasu was good but nothing extraordinary . It was quite pricey but a nice treat for special occasions - - came here for our anniversary . Will we return? Maybe just not any time soon . *ETIQUETTE* Also do not be a \"D\" and talk on your cellphone during the experience like the scrub seated next to me .

       " '\"Laughter is the brightest where food is the best . \" ― Irish ProverbAh a Chandler staple stince 2003 and one of the best place to get some Irish fair . They usually host a crazy party during St . Patrick Day filled with Guinness live bands and all that funk for an entry fee . They are located in the United Blood Service plaza that houses a cigar bar a Subway and a marijuana dispensary . It all wooden and kitschy inside with Irish music playing in the background . But wait actual lamb in Shepherd Pie? Excellent ! I hate it when people advertise their cottage pie as a shepherd pie and then you get a plate with minced beef and not lamb . It the worst and makes me rage . The shepherd pie here at Fibber is pretty dang amazing . The potatoes are insanely rich and creamy . Like you can feel your arteries clogging as you eat this by the forkful . Do not worry though just wash it all down with a Half & Half [I m not talking cream folks] . I do enjoy their pretzel sticks appetizers when it hot from the kitchen . Let it cool and they become boulders . The Bangers & Colcannon are pretty good as well . The mash potatoes have kale in it and has a mushroom onion gravy on top . Stop in if you are craving Irish food ! To be noted this place is Seattle Seahawks friendly . Marc M . and Flash would be comfortable here . ',\n",
       " 'Coming off my less than satisfying meals at Nathan and Pan Asian (granted they are food court joints but still ! ) I was in dire need of a \"real\" meal . Unfortunately though by the time I could grab dinner (10pm) my options were limited especially since I was not in the mood to wander far . Insert Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill whose namesake I would long been curious about but had never bothered trying . But hey if work is going to pay for it why not?Beyond my curiosity about Wolfgang Puck coming here was also driven by how easy it was to grab a table as well as their hours (11 :30am to 6 :00am? ! ) . Looking over the menu several things caught my eye (they have appetizers salads pastas pizzas and a mix of entrees) but I was not quite sure what to get since I was not familiar with what their namesake is known for (as in dishes not his multitude of restaurants) . - - ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS with Crispy Kale . . . $12(https : www . yelp . com biz_photos wolfgang - puck - bar - and - grill - las - vegas - las - vegas?select = F0ijYEWTingrcT077Zbeqg)Not sure what to make of this one . The sprouts and kale were fine and the bacon added a nice saltiness . However the bacon was not a pleasant surprise if you do not eat pork (it not listed on the menu) and made the dish both greasy and a bit sweet (it might have had maple on it) . - - RIGATONI with Fennel Sausage Bolognese Parmesan and Italian Parsley . . . $26(https : www . yelp . com biz_photos wolfgang - puck - bar - and - grill - las - vegas - las - vegas?select = RdAVp_Cwk0W6DhijCnqcTw)I would have been happy with something warm and comforting but this was great ! The portion was quite fair and it tasted fantastic ! The pasta was well cooked and not overly sauced but the bolognese was the star - not super sweet well seasoned and just a bit meaty . Well worth ordering ! As far as service goes it was pretty awesome but still had one major flaw . While the hostess and \"assistant\" servers were super friendly and helpful my primary server was lacking on the latter . Particularly when it came to answer questions about what they Wolfgang Puck are known for ; sorry but \"Uhh . . . depends on what you like\" \"he good at everything he makes\" and \"pizzas seem popular\" do not really do much . Other than my primary server as well as that sprouts dish my experience here was surprisingly satisfying . I may not have had high expectations but it was still a solid meal and I would be happy to get the rigatoni again (or to try something new) . Though I may not go out of my way to come back this is a good option to have late into the night ! ',\n",

I have been coming here once a year or more for almost 20 years and it never changes . Ever . This is a good thing . Prices really are not that bad for what you get especially when you look at many other choices in Vegas . I just have to laugh and shake my head when I see bad reviews of this fun little place . Oh boo hoo the wine is not top shelf the waiter took too long the prices are too high . Seriously? Take the stick out of your ass try to smile and enjoy this gem of a restaurant for what it is . It is a legendary fun kitschy classic old Italian restaurant that is not trying to be something it not . Relax and take some time to look at all the decor and pictures on the walls . Everyone from Elvis to Ol Blue eyes to Liberace and everyone in between has eaten here . That just cool old school . Soak in the ambiance and the low lighting Get tipsy with the free wine . Yes the 2 full carafe of both red and white wine and the bread is FREE . The dinner is standard Italian fare and is always delicious if not predictable . The bread is always fresh and the bring you a nice cappuccino to complete your meal . The very best part of eating at Battista however is Gordy . This 90 + years young gentleman is the salt of the earth . He will play you a song on his accordion that will make you smile every time guaranteed . Wearing a baseball cap? He will play take me out to the ballgame . Feeling romantic he will play That Amore . Wonderful man and a treasure in Las Vegas . ',\n",

We packed 8 people in 2 rooms rather easily considering we are a bunch of high maintenance space mongering bitches lugging around a ton of crap in giant suitcases .

       " 'You do not see a lot of Indian restaurants in casino these days . Or any day as a matter of fact . Royal may be the only one that I can think of at the top of my head . I bought a coupon for this place and decided to check it out . Royal at the Rio hotel is located on an obscure corner of the casino so just keep asking around and I m sure you will find it . Once you do you will notice that this is a really impressive looking Indian restaurant . High ceilings great decor the whole shebangabang . After sitting down I ordered my food and waited . Shortly after ordering I was given a complimentary papadum a sort of cracker that was made from chickpea flour with a couple of dipping sauces . This was nice as I never had this before and quite nice . I liked the tamarind dipping sauce but did not care too much for the green mint one . The Vegetarian Thali platter then came out . It was basically a sampling of some of their vegetarian dishes a side of rice dessert and a naan cut into quarters . When reading the menu it sounds like more than what actually comes out . The naan was really good and I do like my naan a little bit more on the \"toastier\" side . The flavors I think were all there but I would consider it to be a more conservative approach to Indian food . And that is understandable considering that they cater to a lot of people from all over the world . But at $30 for a plate of vegetarian food . . . there can be better value located elsewhere on the menu . The table next to me ordered the Royal Surf and Turf and after seeing that I should have paid the extra $2 instead . The service here was on point . The hostess was friendly and helped me with a lot of my questions . The server was good at anticipating my needs . If you are craving some Indian food and do not have a car rental and do not know anyone in Vegas who can drive you around and stay at the Rio . . well you have Royal .

It certainly better than waiting for the \"volcano\" at The Mirage to erupt the destruction of Pompeii in the Forum Shops attached to Caesar Palace or to see the recorded porn - level acting with random dancing in Treasure Island pirate show .

       " 'I do not usually write 5* reviews from my bed while I m still wiping croissant crumbs off my rack after just one delivery \"visit\" but we live in strange times and today was a stressful day . People decompress in different ways : mine was to check the Yelp ! app to see if Squarz delivered because I was dreaming about Joyce W pictures from the other day . So as I sit here watching the end of \"Titanic\" on Lifetime still hating Rose because she literally let go of Jack right after saying \"I will never let go \" I decided to upload my pics and drop a quick review . Originally I ordered through Eat24 and the owner called to say they were out of cinnamon roll croissants ; as he rattled off alternatives I remembered Joyce picture of the creme brûlée croissant and chose that instead . I also ordered : spinach & feta shepherds and chicken pot pies the prosciutto mozzarella & fig sandwich with fresh fruit mac & cheese with bacon and creamy garlic mashed potato sides and the creamy tomato soup . Annnd a kouign - amann and the aforementioned creme brûlée . . . Do not judge me people today sucked ! Anyway all of the above arrived quickly and piping hot . The owner delivered it himself and told Scott he threw in a \"couple (three ! ) of (chocolate) croissants because we were out of cinnamon . \" Super nice and appreciated . Everything was delicious I took a quick bite of the spinach and feta pie then literally tore open the dessert container to taste the caramelized kouign - amman Scott mouth was agape at my ferocity ha ! It . is . perfection . So naturally I had to try the creme brûlée before eating my dinner : the top layer shattered the croissant was flaky and the pastry cream between layers took it to another level of dessert Nirvana . I did eventually taste my sandwich which was a savory - sweet balance I loved the soup and the sides . Each item was truly noteworthy Scott enjoyed the savory pies and desserts . We are going back . I do not care if I have to live on the stairmaster and drag my old butt to Pump more often this is worth it . I m already impressed with the customer service and the food is phenomenal .

       " 'We came in for lunchtime AYCE and sat at the bar . We were one of two couples . There was only one chef and one waitress . Call me a purist non - adventurous whatever . But I firmly believe that sushi does not need to be fried and covered in sauce to be good . In fact that my least favorite kind . Unfortunately most every special roll offered was drowning in ponzu . It was good for the first one or two but did not leave a good feeling in my stomach after that . The fish it self was not of good quality and that was apparent in the two pieces of nigiri we had - a tuna and salmon . Standard and easy enough to judge across the board . The tuna had a weird texture . It was off . You could tell it was frozen previously and it tasted like nothing . The rice was also lacking in terms of taste and texture . Salmon was the same story . By the time we were ready for our check 3 or 4 other parties had come in . The waitress was notified but decided to take and run orders for 15 + minutes after the fact . We left cash instead of waiting for however much longer we would have had to and dipped . Was hoping for a better experience because of other YE reviews . ',\n",
       " 'Cosmic Trickster I am not amused . What are you trying to teach me? That fast food eats castor oil popsicles? Did I write too many favorable reviews for chains? Well Boston Market is not too too bad actually . This was my first BM encounter in more than a few moons . I used to really really like Rotisserie chickens . I still do actually . They used to be an occasional spontaneous treat when brought home from a deli ( Hey ! Rotisserie ! Let get one ! ) . So when the Boston Market franchise first came on the scene I was fairly excited about the prospect of getting roasted chickens pretty much whenever I wanted from a restaurant that specializes in them . No I have never been to a Kenny Roger Roasters and it been 7 - 8 years since I have been to a George Aiken . Boston Market (formerly Boston Chicken) has also seemingly branched out into other areas going out of their way to offer a homey take on fast food the idea being that you can eat a BM meal at home in your dining room with the good silverware on the good plates reserving Crazy Bread or McNuggets for the woodland critters out in the backyard . Now the Boston Market chickens are tender enough (many places roast their chickens for too long) but I have always felt there was something missing from them . Actually I take that back their chickens have a funny taste I m not sure I like one that suggests that I m dining on Frankenchickens or something . Is it because they are frozen? Not that they are awful in any way mind you I have just never liked their chickens as much as I feel I should . I guess the word I m looking for is bland?Hooray for their army of side dishes . Well they do give you a lot of choices but like the chicken they are mostly just passable . I usually get the green beans and the garlic dill taters neither of which are bad nor rock my culinary socks off . But . . . wait . . . . . . there the . . . Cinnamon Apples . These are not a side dish . They are a dessert . I always forget how good they are until I have them and while I m eating them I always imagine how good they would taste as a hot sundae topper . But I always end up eating them all before that happens and never have any ice cream around to slather the apples onto . Why is it that we were served applesauce in school and never the almost erotically warm Cinnamon Apples? Was the faculty afraid of corrupting us? Or spoiling us? Making us realize that school cafeteria fare does not have to suck? Staying on the dessert track we had an order of their Chocolate Brownies free I might add with some deal and they are actually reasonably appetizing . They are cut into triangles which is a nice touch . Instead of being heavy and gooey they are just moist enough and very . . . cocoa - ish as if you are munching on a soft Oreo cookie without the white stuff . What do you have in store for me next Cosmic Trickster? Will you steer me towards the worst meal of my life or the best? Methinks this was the calm before some sort of storm . A big concert weekend approaches after all . . . Right now I m left with the remnants of a nice safe 3 star dinner and Jon Stewart on the telly . ',\n",

I was like HELLS YES ! ! ! - - mustard ! ? Never drank anything with mustard in it ! Well . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

       " 'I have to admit I was dubious of all the rave reviews . We waited in line for maybe 20 minutes . Sadly the man right in front of us took the last of the sliced brisket . Our group had a pork rib sausage pulled pork the jalapeño cheddar grits coleslaw the LAST pecan pie and chopped brisket . All of it was great . The brisket and pecan pie we took home for my husband who was not with us . My husband did not eat the sandwich until the next day but said it was still great . Now he definitely wants to taste it fresh . I have never been a grits fan but decided to give it a try to see if this one was actually as good as the reviews said . I really enjoyed it similar to mashed potatoes but slightly different texture . To be honest I probably would still skip it so I could eat more meat . I also would not get a sandwich again not because it is not good but because the meat is so good I do not want to fill up on the bread . My fav was the sausage and I m super picky (usually disliking it) but this was really good . They have 3 BBQ sauces : house spicy and mustard . All were good but the house was fantastic . To top it off the owner not only serves (he was taking the initial order and chopping the meat) and passes out samples while chopping then later came out to talk to his customer . We will be back !

Favorites include the quiche (perfect for a late breakfast ! ) the salmon club (it even travels well ! ) and the ratatouille rolls (I grab them as a side for my protein at home) . The broccoli - guacamole was an interesting app (and I would love to see what they could do with a pea version ! ) but the desserts are where they shine . The menu lists which desserts are healthier and which are more indulgent which is helpful as they all look amazing . The strawberry - rhubarb macaron (healthy side) was a delight but the Exotic Fruits (combining coconut passion fruit and matcha) recommended by the staff was even better reminding me of Yonaka desserts with the beautiful plating and Japanese flavor influence . Staff provides excellent service Nicolas in particular always looks genuinely happy to help each patron . The interior is a fun mix of modern furniture and garden decor accents complete with miniature terrariums on the tables . So glad this spot opened in such a convenient location - now I can grab a great meal before or after the gym without compromising on flavor or my goals ! ',\n",
       " 'We tried Public School 702 shortly after they opened for business . We started with a couple of appetizers . I did not love the calamari but I typically do not enjoy fried calamari so that was not too surprising . The tater tots were the highlight of the appetizers . For an entree I ordered the cobb burger and chose the kale and brussel sprout slaw . When my food came they had given me fries instead but quickly noticed their error and brought me the slaw . The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors were great . Lots of bleu cheese and drippy egg and the slaw was on point as well . I enjoyed my meal quite a bit . The service was very attentive . Some were a bit overzealous since the restaurant just opened but I appreciated the extra effort . I would be interested in coming back to try more of their menu and possibly happy hour someTime soon . ',\n",

I lived across the street from in & out burger for 3 years - they are good but - fatburger is #1 . always good service fast & friendly staff place is always clean & the decor is traditional burger stand . we love it ! ! ! Get yourself a baby fat meal with fat fries & a shake you wo not regret it . Voted Best Fast - Food Burger ! ',\n",
       " 'Hungry one late afternoon in Vegas we decided to go off strip and try one of Minh bookmarks that he had . Hot dogs sounded like they would totally hit the spot since i had been craving them for the past week ! Located in a large shopping center (it can be a bit tricky to find this place as we were lost for a moment on the other side of the center) . If you keep a look out for Chicago Brewing Company you are in the right spot my friend just look to your left err right and you will see it ! Walking up to Buldogis I noticed outside that they are pet friendly a huge water bowl sat outside just waiting for the next thirsty doggy to come by . As we entered we were greeted by a friendly hello from the cashier the menu is posted above the register but they also have menus on the tables if you do not feel like standing in front of the register with an I - do not - know - what - to - have look on your face . There is a lot to choose from and for a first timer like me I was going back and forth with myself on what my final decision would be to order . I settled with getting :Buckeye Dog - Pork belly bacon Corn relish Cheddar cheese and Garlic Mayo . We also ordered small fries which had Italian Herb Parmesan cheese and other special spices that they kept a secret from us ! After we placed our order we sat down and waited for our food to be prepared . The dining area is on the smaller side but cozy . Two large plasma TV on each side of the room were showing either Food Network or The Travel channel . Our food was brought out to us by the cashier it looked and smelled great . Let dig in because I am hungry ! My Buckeye dog was huge ; they piled on the topping and left no empty spaces between the hot dog and the super soft bun . First intention was to just pick it up and bite into it as I usually do with a hot dog except I could not find a perfect spot to sink my teeth into . So I had to cut into that sucker with a knife and fork and eat it that way . The dog was juicy and not greasy at all . Warning if you are not careful half the toppings will either land on the table or in your lap it that messy ! ! The small fries were enough for two people to share and came with ketchup to dip the fries into . We left full and happy ! Great customer service Buldogis ! ! ! ! ',\n",
       " 'Dined at Olive and Ivy last Friday night (very romantical date I might add) . Our reservation was at 8 :30pm we arrived about 30 minutes early and they were able to seat us right away . It was cougar central in there so I held my date close because he a few years my junior . . . . they were eying us like prize winning hogs or a coupon for 1 2 price Restylane injections . It was insane . I mean people were noticeably discussing our arrival . These women were not even trying to hide the shit talking . So mad props \"geriatric mafia\" at the bar . Do not hate ! The wine alone is what warrants 3 stars . Two words : Arizona Stronghold . High five for the local support . As far as dinner goes we ordered the Seared Scallops and Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with side orders of Mascarpone Polenta and Roasted Mushrooms . My date and I happen to enjoy small plate dining and the server was nice enough to split everything up for us so we did not have to feed each other . The food was . . . . . . get ready for it . . . . . . . . . okay . Yes just okay . The quality of the ingredients were phenomenal but flavor wise it just did not deliver . Do not get me wrong I do not have anything horrible to say but sorry not having something bad to say just is not good enough for a $170 . 00 dining experience . I will probably go back and give it another shot at some point . I m really glad I went with my gut instinct and did not order the Filet because I am a total fucking steak snob . I have a feeling this review would have read something completely different and dropped in rating . Maybe brunch?P . S . The chocolate martini was sex in a glass . . . . . . . like actual sex . . . . . in a glass . You figure it out . :)',\n",
       " 'You know when a donut shop only accepts cash and is run by an older couple the donuts are about to be fire AF .

Their cake donuts are BY FAR my favorite donuts I have ever had and that includes some pretty fancy donut shops . ',\n",
       " 'Darn it . I just realized as I started to write my review that I had a choice of coffee cake but the waitress simply asked me what kind of toast I wanted which made me forget the coffee cake ! The coffee cake denial almost forced me to take a two star deduction because I can make better toast than the whole wheat that was delivered to me instead of the cakey treat . However I will be kind . . . for now . I ordered a vegetarian skillet and had them hold the cheese . I recommend this if you want a little lighter breakfast . I added some ketchup and hot sauce to create a delicious offering . The ingredients seemed fresh and there was no heavy breakfast grease . The skillet potatoes were not covered with any magic dusting of spices but they were still tasty . One added bonus is that with most of the breakfasts they offer a choice of shredded hash browns or cubed potatoes . Have you ever been to Waffle House? Well these hash browns are like those except with about 1 3 of the grease and I am pretty sure you cannot get them diced smothered and covered . On a Saturday morning around 9 :30am there was no wait . Our waitress was nice and prompt . Our food was delivered in a timely manner . I will be back for my coffee cake . ',\n",
       " 'Guilty pleasure you are calling my name . Every now and then I will drive out of my way to eat at Chino Bandido . It kind of sad actually . On a night when I m alone and taking a much needed break from going out with friends I will order up a ridiculous meal of fried rice Cuban black beans and jade red chicken in a quesidilla . Then I will sit down with my friend the DVR and watch bad TV . Basically I do two things that are embarrassing to do with others : watch horrible TV and eat horribly unhealthy food . Sometimes I actually let a friend join me and after the taste explosion in our mouths has worn off we are left grabbing our stomachs and moaning in pain \"I am never eating this again . \" When you eat a meal at Chino just know that you are done . You will not be doing anything else for the rest of the day night you will not go dancing you will not go on a bike ride and you will not be having any sex . You will just sit there until your stomach digests all the contents of that round metal container they cram everything into . Enjoy . ',\n",
       " 'I thought for some time before assigning a five - star rating to this one . And after my extensive contemplation I am confident in saying that this was a five - star experience . If the criteria for five stars is \"as good as it gets\" then I would say without reservation that Vintner Grill is as good as Vegas gets . Here the breakdownAMBIANCE : 5FOOD TASTE QUALITY : 5FOOD CREATIVITY : 4SERVICE : 4 . 5Overall what I like about Vintner Grill was that it delivered on providing an experience . And there are are not many places in this town (off - strip) that even attempt to do that . The overall aesthetic is a modern take on a light Art Deco 1930s decor . Everything from the black and white checkered floor to the white and pastel green color scheme worked to set a mood from the moment you walk in . If you are reading other reviews you already know the restaurant is located inside a business center - - and it that very juxtaposition between the bland stucco sameness of the business center and soft light and glossy interior of the restaurant that left me feeling transported . The contrast of the business center location totally works in Vintner Grill favor by creating an immediate expectation of luxury and quality . And Vintner delivers on both fronts . Our party ordered and shared :Two of their signature cocktailsCheese and meat platterLamb bologneseNY stripHalibut on couscous and orzoWhite bean hummusTiramisuCarmel upside down cakeTurkish coffee cheesecakeWe were thoroughly pleased with all but one dish - and even that dish (cheesecake) was fine . The dishes were not overly creative and clever but they were all seasoned well made with high quality ingredients and prepared with skill . The food was delicious . The seafood was fresh and buttery while the steaks were tender and cooked perfectly . This was one of the two best NY strip steaks I have had in this town . The bolognese was heavy and the truffle oil threatened to over power the flavor of the sauce but the richness of the lamb and sauce made for a dish that most people at our table called the best of the night . The service was considered the food was delicious and the decor atmosphere was luxurious . I will definitely return to Vintner Grill . ',\n",
       " 'So we came here a few years ago and had a bad experience with the service and the food . Fast forward to 2012 - we decided to give the Grill another try - it was good . We continued to patronize the Grill and even told friends that we enjoyed it ! Huh what a HUGE mistake ! We went with our neighbors who were VERY reluctant but were willing to try again . To say it was a disaster is being kind . The manager Mike (yes YOU MIKE) was a total jerk . We waited a good hour for our food and my husband who ordered a sirloin burger got his order WITHOUT the burger ! What a total joke this place is ! The manager MIKE (yes YOU MIKE) is a first class worthless idiot ! There are plenty if other good places that would be delighted to have our business ! I felt sorry for the waitress who had to put up with pathetic MIKE (yes YOU MIKE) ! Do yourself a favor and patronize somewhere other than the Grill . ',\n",
       " 'This is was eh ok . Not eh I have had better and not A - OK . It was eh shoulder shrug . Came here for dinner with some awesome peeps Anthony (always fabulous) Cathy and Mark . The company was great . We always have a fun time . The service was good above average . However $15 . 95 for beef chicken or pork fajitas seems high to me . ($1 extra for shrimp) . For a combo it $25 . 95 (again a buck more for shrimp) . The side of guac and sour cream was not enough (I mean is there ever enough sour cream? Me thinks not) . The fajita tasted OK . But for a place that specializes in them I thought they would have more wow . They serve horchada which I love . And even that didnt impress me . It tasted weak and strong on cinnamon . They do serve complimentary chips salsa and beans . I happened to like the beans but the salsa was not good . I would not say it expensive necessarily but it certainly not cheap food . I wont say I will never come back but it not a place I will be back any time soon . ',\n",
       " 'It was late I was starving and this is the closest taco shop to my house so I decided to give it a go . The thing that got me most excited prearrival was that they offered al pastor 24 7 . Not much can beat great al pastor and I have yet to find anything that tops my beloved (and closed down) Tacos Los Parados al pastor so I had high hopes . Those hopes dashed away as soon as I was at the counter and saw the pastor spinning on the spit . It was as if it had been on there for a couple of days . I then realized how difficult it must be to maintain quality pastor around the clock . This is why there are not any 24 hour shawarma joints . Yet I was in denial and ordered 2 pastor tacos and 2 chicken tacos for $1 . 79 a piece to go . 10 minutes later all 4 tacos were crammed into a foil package the size of a PB&J sandwich . I was surprised at how small it all was that I asked the cashier \"Is this everything?\" . I get home and realized that I had just ordered the smallest tacos in the world . I read an article a while back that the current (maybe not by the time you read this) New York Jets coach Rex Ryan would eat 12 tacos for dinner before he had gastric bypass . He certainly was not eating these babies . The chicken was fine and as I had expected the pastor was dry . Perhaps I need to go during peak hours when it fresh?Roberto is definitely their main competitor and in the cheap and ghetto Vegas taco game Roberto wins . ',\n",
       " 'Came here with the boyfriend who was skeptical of this place because he does not see the difference between going to get his hair cut professionally and the usual me shaving his head in the kitchen into something that resembles a misshapen - ed salad bowl . We came with a Livingsocial deal and our first impression was that it was had a very unique and cool mood going on . The bf lit up at their beer specials and I have to say that for 2 bucks a Stella and everything else it a good deal whether or not you come for a haircut . Tried the food and it was not anything too special when you could just walk a couple of shops down to TK tavern . Here the problem : We came in told them about the coupon we had and then we had to wait for a stylist even though there was a stylist just chilling with nothing to do and other walk - ins without the coupon went before us . After our last horrifying groupon experience this alerted my boyfriend that we were going to get a sh*t - tastic experience here as well because we are those with the coupons . Finally he got a barber asked for a simple number 3 haircut but to leave the top of his hair long . Instead the barber just buzzed off all of his hair until he looked like a monk and did an even crappier job shaving off his sideburns leaving him with patches . We were done in less than 5 minutes whereas everyone else getting their haircut were attended to like they were supposed to . My boyfriend was embarrassed and just wanted to get out because it the second time it happened we have gotten second - rate treatment because of our coupon . If the owner is a bald guy then he was there and even directed us to this specific barber who did not talk or anything just shaved and was told us he was done . Save yourself the money and go to your local barbershop who will treat you right without the expensive costs and actually listen to your needs without judging you . ',\n",

       " 'Technically Roy is outside the northern boundary of which I would drive for a meal but since it was to be a free meal and I would not be doing the driving how could I say no? It is a chain but in Roy defense the majority of the menu items are created by the local chefs with only a portion of the menu available at all restaurants . Roy is billed as Hawaiian fusion but my first thought was \"oh no there sushi on the menu I wo not like this place . \" I am happy to say I was wrong . Do not let my husband read this . He thinks I m never wrong . My husband also always says I m stuck in the 80 so I ordered the 1988 cocktail (grapefruit and pomegranate with a grapefruit vodka and lychee liqueur) . Since I was the lone drinker I stuck with one but could have easily had 2 or 3 more of these especially with a little Duran Duran background music . We started with Roy Canoe Appetizer for Two adjusted for three . It includes lobster potstickers and teppanyaki shrimp both of which were really good . Also on the boat were Thai beef satay and spicy tuna roll neither of which I tried . My husband vouched for the tuna roll however . Next up was the grilled endive apple and bleu cheese salad with pomegranate vinaigrette . If you are a salad lover you would probably love it . If you are a salad hater you would probably love it too . For my entree the pancetta crusted Alaskan halibut with tomatoes and chevre mushroom ravioli . This too was fantastic although there was a little too much oil on the plate maybe from the pancetta?? But the fish was nicely prepared and the ravioli was excellent . My husband insisted on the chocolate souffle which must be ordered at the start of your meal but due to a glitch with our pregnant server needing a bathroom break it did not get put in early enough . We waited and were given a starter dessert on the house and both the server and the gal who forgot to put the order in both profusely apologized . Hey I would gladly welcome another screw up if a second dessert was involved . The souffle was lick your plate good and the blueberry tart (I think that was the name of it) was incredibly good as well . So good I may have to break my driving rule and have dessert there again . Probably 4 . 5 stars but I m feeling stingy today . ',\n",
       " '11 11 10Was in the area for a November OYE that was about to start in 30 minutes but I was so hungry and did not really think my second meal - of - the - day comprised of pie cake pastries and wine was a healthy way to end the evening w so I decided I would check out Red Devil . It was dead inside (only a couple was there for dinner) and I got the feeling that most of the business that evening was going to be take - outs . Bartender was friendly enough until I started asking questions about the ingredients . He still remained accessible but the smiles certainly went away . I almost stood up and left . When the food arrived 25 minutes later I wished I had left ! I found the calzone crust soggy - no crispiness anywhere and the mozzarella - ricotta mix made for an ugly bland - tasting (I detected no ricotta flavor at all) conglomeration . (See photos . ) The only thing that turned out OK was the marinara sauce but what good is it if the item you are supposed to eat it w is not worth the trouble? I had the leftovers boxed and stood up to go after only spending 5 minutes eating . After all I had a party to attend ! p . s . What a poor example of a treehugger I am ! No sooner had I exited RD doors did I take the first chance to throw the leftovers in the trash . Should have just left it on the table . . . ',\n",
       " 'One of my favorite eating spots in Las Vegas . I have been to other Filipino restaurants in LV and this one by far surpasses them all . This cafeteria style restaurant has the largest selection of Filipino cuisine . Think of any Filipino dish . . . . and they will have it ! It can be pretty overwhelming at first because there are just too many dishes to choose from . I recommend going with more than 2 people so you can share different dishes . I usually go here during lunch and I will be full until way after dinner . Their two - item combos are killer with large servings . . . and for less than $5 you will be more content here than eating at a more expensive restaurant on the strip . Make sure they serve your dishes in separate bowls so you can share them around the table . Here are just a few flavorful dishes that I have enjoyed here throughout the years :LaingChicken AdoboLechon Kuwali Kare Kare Pork AdoboChicken ApritadaPaksiw na Pata MenudoBBQ chicken Beef CalderetaSinigang na BaboyPalabokPinakbetDinuguan Halo Halo . . . . and that only scratching the surface . They have more items laid out . . . . all nice and hot . Oh and let not forget . . . they offer Nilaga soup with your dine - in order (by the cashier) . Service is good . . . never had a problem with that . However cleanliness can sometimes be questionable . The cheap prices and wide variety of great tasting authentic Filipino food explain why I have never seen this restaurant without a line . But do not worry the line goes pretty quick . . . . especially when you are having trouble deciding what two items to get . If you are ever stuck in that rut go ahead and get three items ! Just do not expect to eat again until the next day . ',\n",
       " 'Thailicious is Delicious ! Food :Very good ! I ordered the Pad Prik Khing with chicken . I wanted something fairly spicy so I asked for a \"4\" on their scale of 1 - 5 . It was fairly spicy but next time I will ask for \"5\" . The dish includes rice on the side which I appreciated . That way I could decide how much rice to add to my plate . The Pad Prik Khing has a good portion of green beans which were cooked just right - they had a nice snap not mushy at all . I asked for fish sauce with diced chilis and they brought out a little box with that plus chili sauce and chili flakes . I only tried the fish sauce and it added another layer of flavor to my food . Recommended ! Cost :I paid $12 including tax which I felt was very reasonable . Service : Outstanding ! The place was not crowded at all especially for a Saturday evening . Well it was really early so there that . . . Anyway I was greeted and seated immediately by a very friendly hostess . She brought me an ice water with lemon slices right away including a carafe for refills . A different person took my order and only 13 minutes later she brought it to the table . Impressively prompt . Several times during my meal someone came to ask how everything was or if I needed anything else . This was just right not enough to be annoying . Atmosphere :Nice . They were playing fairly quiet jazz music and water features near the entrance and near the rest rooms also added to the mix . The decor is not over - the - top Thai but it tasteful . Also the men room was very clean - always a good sign ! Overall :This was a very pleasant experience .

When we entered Crystals which is a high - end shopping mall I became very skeptical . But I forget . This is Vegas ; a place that can truly surprise you at every turn with it ability to take the seemingly ordinary and make it extravagant . Social House atmosphere was filled with the swanky lighting decor and music that you can find only in Sin City . We decided to go with the chef menu . Meaning the 6 of us dining spouted off things we did not like (cucumber and salmon) and left the rest to the chef . Course after course came out with each one better than the next . The dishes were perfectly cooked (when applicable) dressed in the best of sauces and presented beautifully . Yellowtail sashimi kobe beef sliders edamame (I know it seems weak but it was phenomenal) and a ginormous roll platter . There were several other dishes but I cannot even remember everything ! It ran pretty pricey - about $100 per person but if you are open to trusting the chef and trying a smattering of dishes it will not disappoint ! It was the best meal I have ever eaten . ',\n",

It close to my job so I thought today was the day I go check them out during my lunch hour . Service is friendly and fast I was arrived a little after 11 :30 it was still slow I m sure the lunch rush was coming soon . But I was able to pick any place to sit . After checking out the menu I went with the Heaven Ginger with chicken it was ginger onions mushrooms bell peppers & scallions in a house bean sauce and a side of steamed rice & crispy roll . I also ordered it Thai Hot . The heat was a little lacking for me it was more like a level 2 not a Thai Hot the flavor of the dish was good too it just seemed to be lacking something it was an ok dish it was not spectacular or mind blowing just a good lunch . The salad was a typical iceberg lettuce blend with carrots and to add to it some sliced cucumbers & tomatoes with a warm peanut sauce dressing and the soup was a sweet & sour soup . The peanut dressing had great flavor just a little runnier than I like I like it a little thicker so it sticks to the lettuce leaf and not just run off the leaf . The soup it was surprisingly good it had the perfect blend of sweet & sour . Thailicious makes a decent lunch not spectacular but good . Did not have anything wrong with my meal just did not get blown away . ',\n",

Everything Vic serves is top notch starting with the buns to the dogs to the condiments (especially the spicy mustard and ketchup he makes himself) to the toppings . But the real star of the show is the chili . We are not talking browned meat with a little sauce here . We are talking about chili that is loaded with meat beans spices and flavor . Chili that travels the region and wins prizes at festivals . Chili that has been crafted and refined over a lifetime . Chili that will make you slap your mama ! But wait there more ! You do not just get a great meal you will get entertainment too . Vic is a heck of a personable guy and none to shy . Depending on the time of day the line can grow a little long .

I think that is why it is so good . The name translates to The Two Grinders . The story goes that both the husband and wife had a meat grinder that they brought into the family that had been passed down through the generations . So they decided on that name because it was cool and it is . This location is the home (ranch) of an old Cowboy Movie Star . Though I cannot remember his name right now . Ask when you go . It is a great place . Lots of cool decour . The food is nice and spicy . New Mexico style spicy which is a little different than Mexican style foods . They start you out with some chips and salsa . One Green and one Red . Both delish if you can take the heat . The sauses are really good fresh and tasty . Everything you get there mmm !

Throw in a simple lounge where Crystal is behind the bar blending up Chocolate Chip Cookie milkshake cocktails I m with you into the afterlife . My first visit to Peppermill was in the morning after a long night . The wait is usually an hour plus on a weekend morning so plan accordingly . In my case planning accordingly means heading straight to the lounge and ordering a Bloody Mary . I do not want to say that Peppermill served up the best bloody I have had in Vegas so far but I have to say that because it true . Not too watery just the right amount of spice and that wor - chest - chire sauce that nobody can really ever spell or say correctly took it to a whole new level of tomato glory . Once our table was called we finished our cocktails grabbed our bucket of Coronas and had breakfast . Eggs and bacon with an english muffin . Delish with a capital D and my perfect equation for curing a hangover . My most recent adventure brought me back late night . Crystal was behind the bar again and mixed me up a blended cocktail called the Chocolate Chip Cookie . Heaven dessert however you want to describe it it darn good . Went for the Rueben at 12 :30am and I m so glad I did . The ratio of meat to sauerkraut was impressive . The last minute addition to order a random drink off the cocktail list based on the name you liked seemed like a great idea at the time . I opted for the Snuggler a hot chocolate with Rumplemintz which was tasty but wildly unnecessary at that hour . Peppermill I will see you again real soon . ',\n",

Instead Pita Jungle is a lowkey spot to get some good Mediterranean food . I had filled up on good eats at the Yelp event so I just split some pita and hummus with Jared M . And yes the hummus is as good as the other yelpers claim . . . mmm . Gabi had not pigged out at the event like we had so she ordered her favorite macro platter - it appeared to be both healthy and delicious !

The Sushi Chef started up a chainsaw and was coming our way lit up only by the tiny jack - o - lantern hidden in his chef hat . The front doors were blocked by the waiter . There was no place to run no place to hide . . . . . OK that did not really happen just a scary Halloween tale for the season . What did happen was a very nice lunch . I had a salmon roll and then the teriyaki salmon bento box . My friend went with Spicy Tuna roll and chicken teriyaki box . Everything was very fresh and tasted good . Similar to other places where I have ordered similar items . I was not wowed but I was very happy with the portions and flavor for $9 . 95 salmon box and $5 . 50 salmon roll . Miso soup was pretty basic definitely not the best I have had . They have another location on my side of town that I did not even know existed near Lake Mead and Rampart . Will have to try it out . I did not notice any drink specials but that does not mean they do not have one . I will go back and sample a few more of their dishes .

So I understood completely when he warned one of the guys in my party to be a gentler with the machine and from there we all made it a point to play gentle pinball . After that we made our way to the Foosball Hockey table . Playing in teams we had a competitive game going (while still being gentle I promise) . Excitement was brewing there was some cheering going on and the next thing we know the power on the game goes out . We turn and look and Mister Grumpy Pants has the plug in his hand yelling at us to leave or he would get his off duty cop friend to arrest us? Then he started spouting a bunch of bull about how we were not members and it was a private club and we basically were not welcome there .

       " 'This Wolfgang restaurant is one of the more affordable ones on the strip . It located across from Ká at the MGM . They do not take reservations . Our group of eight was lucky enough to get a table right away at 6 :30pm for a mid - week dinner . After that it started to get real busy . 5 stars - Focaccia topped with caramelized onions . Complimentary . This was the highlight of the bread basket that everyone was clamoring over . The focaccia was savory soft warm and really got us all hungry for dinner . 4 stars - Vegetable Pizza . Oven Roasted Tomatoes Basil Pesto Mozzarella and Nicoise Olives . My favorite kind of pizza is always one that starts with a base of pesto and cheese . This one hit the spot . I liked the thin crust that had just enough veggies to not weigh down the pizza or make it soggy . 4 stars - Spaghetti . Plum Tomatoes Garlic Sweet Basil and Pecorino Romano . Thank you for getting the pasta right . It was cooked to a perfect al dente with a nice chew to the spaghetti . The marinara sauce was a good balance of sweet tomato and savory garlic and Romano cheese . I liked every twirl of spaghetti with this dish . Very good . Our table got a few desserts to share . The chocolate soufflé was the favorite served with a scoop of ice cream and chocolate sauce . Second were the beignets served with a berry jam . These were bite sized and light . Last were the half dozen chocolate chip cookies . Nothing much to rave about there . Overall this is an ideal option for groups with a lot of menu options for everyone to have a great meal . ',\n",
       " 'Note #1 : They are a BYOB establishment . Note #2 : They offer free delivery with a $12 minimum order but I have no idea what their boundaries are . I m guessing they are limited to the Castle Shannon area but I m sure it cannot hurt to call . They do take - out too so you can always shoot over and get it if they wo not bring it to you . My parents owed me a belated birthday dinner and I had not a clue as to where I wanted to go . That was until they got a flyer in the mail for a new Asian eatery in Castle Shannon right down the road from Pho Kim 88 . It yet another entry into the Asian Cuisine Strip Mall War . Does it stand tall? For the most part yes . As it says on their flyer Asian Garden offers a mixture of Chinese and Japanese including sushi sashimi and hibachi . Geez I could not decide where to go eat on my birthday and once I decide on an Asian restaurant I cannot figure out whether to go Chinese or Japanese ! \"Why not go both? It my birthday after all \" I said to myself . I started out with some Tako which is octopus and a wad of rice lashed together with a strip of nori . My sister almost fainted . I thought it was ok . You get two pieces and I finished both without using the attendant wasabi and ginger . The octopus itself was a little gelatinous had texture for days and only a mild flavor . I did not hate it but am not sure if I loved it either . Now I almost got their Chirashi which is \"assorted raw fish on vinegar rice in a bowl\" as their menu states but a \"Chef Special\" called Seven Stars Around The Moon caught my eye . The menu describes it as \"Jumbo Shrimp Lobster Meat Crabmeat Beef Chicken Pork Scallops and Mixed Vegetables in Brown Sauce . \" White rice comes with it in a separate bowl as does that famous red sweet & sour sauce . It was filling for sure so much so that I took about 40% of it home . Each shrimp was tempura battered and fried and puffy and was the best seafood funnel cake fritter thingamajig I have come across in months . And when you dip each morsel into the red sauce goddamn seafood becomes dessert candy . Who wants tuna ice cream when you can have this? The shrimp was the star with everything else becoming a huge tasteful mishmash of proteins and veggies united by that Brown Sauce . All of the other sea critters surrendered unto the Borg . The Fried Dumplings the four of us shared as an appetizer were an instantly familiar crowd pleaser the \"Detroit Rock City\" of our Chinese meals . If it does not happen people go home disappointed y know? Honeyed crispy soft full in flavor and mouthfeel the dumplings were like pastries of pork . Yet again a case is made for meat as a dessert by the Chinese and Asian Garden is not the only Asian restaurant doing them up like this . In quality they were very much like Dormont Amazing Wok and we ate them up eagerly each of us getting two . Dad tried to steal a third . Speaking of Dad and Mom they both liked their Hibachi dinners which had a little bit of steak scallops and shrimp in them . Dad was not nutters over the Miso soup which I finished for him and liked . He was not crazy about his Green Salad with the ginger dressing . I had to finish that for him as well (For what it worth Dad not used to Japanese food but he used to be iffy about Indian cuisine and now he loves it so . . . ) . Anyway AG ginger dressing is not the creamy kind I m used to . It was pretty tangy a little bitter and was not very sweet at all . In terms of consistency it was somewhat akin to a cocktail sauce and that the best comparison I can make . Sis who almost as fussy as Dad (I had to beg her to try the Miso soup) liked her Chicken Lo Mein and Mom being easy to please liked everything . Asian Garden lone dessert offering is ice cream in various flavors that you can have as is or \"fried . \" Considering the Chocolate Sin birthday cake from Potomac Bakery waiting for me at home and my recent date with Overindulgence at Burgatory last weekend I figured it was time to walk away . Guess what else was waiting for me at home? More gift cards ! Cracker Barrel (I can live with that) and . . . ulp . . . TGI Friday (aiiiieeeee ! ! ! )Now officially wise to my secret life on Yelp Dad created a \"freestyle\" that goes \"Darren cannot help it he gotta Yelp it ! \" He also wants me to review EVERY chain in Pittsburgh .

       " 'This shop is set inside a tiny little strip mall and is an equally small space . When we entered we were greeted warmly by the cashier but while we browsed through the menu she disappeared somewhere in the back and we had to wait a long time for her to actually come back to the front . You have many options for your potato . First of all the actual potato . You can have your standard Russet sweet potato or cauliflower if you are going low carb . You also have your choice of sizes (Medium large and extra large) with sample sizes in the glass case at the counter . There are various hearty toppings and meats for your potato and there is also a mixed vegetable topping option . We decided on a large size jambalaya and Buffalo chicken potato with mixed cheese (Monterey jack and cheddar) loaded style (Bacon bits green onion sour cream butter) with fried jalapeños . They both tasted delicious . The jambalaya had a perfectly cooked mixture of shrimp chicken and sausage and the Buffalo chicken sauce had the right amount of vinegary tangy flavor . Both were loaded with a hefty amount of toppings and meat and the combination of textures and flavors was balanced . The real downfall of this place is the waiting time . This is definitely not fast food as it took 45 minutes for 2 potatoes to be made . I was famished when I got here and had I known it would take so long I probably would have gone somewhere else for a quicker meal . Since the space is so miniscule and there is not a lot of air conditioning when it warm your best bet is to place an order ahead of time and get it to go . Overall the potatoes were great but the wait time really killed it for me . ',\n",

We made a reservation for ten people so we can all eat together . That the whole point of a birthday dinner right? They gave us two separate tables of six . How awkward to shout over another table to tell a joke heh . I dislike how every . single . time . I try to show up fashionably late to any friends gathering I somehow manage to always be the first one there ! Dinner starts at 8? Cool I will get there at 8 :15 because I know how slow everyone else is . No dice they get there at 8 :20 . Oh geez . So I m stuck there sipping water as I pretend I m a bored housewife . Anyway . We decide as a part of a group to get the Couples Special and the Woonam choice . That was split and enough for the five of us that decided to share . FOOD : All the meats were flavorful and delicious . Kalbi was the star of the show . The grill at a table of six was pretty small though . They did not turn on the fan for the whole meal until the very end . We did not realize they even had one until it started ! Who else like meat perfume? Perfectly seasoned and each piece of meat was like butter after cooked . Smooth and good choice . Marbled meat was pretty . Pork belly was salty enough on its own but a bit overpowering with slight extra seasoning . SERVICE : For the whole meal we had to flag down our server . They checked up on us maybe a couple times during the beginning but stopped coming for the rest . We asked for water twice . Did not come back for 15 minutes until we asked again . Important to note that it was not busy for the time of night . We were the only table on one side of the restaurant with plenty of servers abound . We received only one soy bean soup and they forgot to give us the other one . When we asked for it the server acted surprised and said that it must have been served at another table . No \"sorry\" whatsoever even in korean . We never got our second soup for the entirety of our meal . When we went to pay we all pulled out our cards cash to split the bill . Note that we did NOT ask for separate checks . The cashier looked irritated sighed loudly and said in korean to her co - worker : \"Oh my god . What a hassle ! \" My friend (birthday girl mind you) just paid it all in cash to make it easier for them . Wow . VERDICT : Great food . Horrible service . I would not come back based on service alone . Not so sure I would want to come back to a place when workers talk about you behind your back in another language when we politely ask for the food drinks we are paying for . ',\n",

       " 'OK - - My fourth review update so you know it has taken a lot of experiences both \"OK\" and \"infuriating\" to get me to this point . My thoughts on the food still stand : Average sushi and typical greasy Americanized Chinese take - out . I will add that while some might not find an oversized roll to be a problem I do . This place makes rolls so massive they are difficult to eat . And is not enjoying eating the point? I like a bite - sized roll that is a balance of all the flavors . Really where Panda Wok has failed me over and over again is the customer service . First when you are placing your order make sure you do their job for them . By this I mean make them confirm your address confirm your order confirm they are delivering confirm they are going to send you chopsticks soy sauce etc . It exhausting but necessary . My last three orders consisted of these experiences : 1) Placed entire order waited over an hour - - guy shows up at the wrong address gets snippy and blames me . Ha ! I had to send the cold food back AND make a call about the crappy service of not just the women who took the order but their delivery guy as well . 2) Next time I placed a complete order and got off the phone no problem - - or so I thought . I got a phone call ten minutes later from the same gal who took my order saying \"I forgot we are not doing deliveries tonight . But I already charged you . Can you come and pick it up?\" HOW do you forget you do not have a delivery person for the evening? ! They could not refund me the delivery charge - - so they gave me a credit for my next order . 3) Third times a charm right? WRONG . This time I placed an order for three rolls and some soup . I get a call from the delivery guy telling me he outside . I walk outside and there no one there . This cannot be happening again right? I confirmed the address on the phone ! I call the guy back and ask him where he is - - this guys gets the nastiest attitude with me AGAIN . He reads back my address to me and my instructions to come to the front - - then snips at me that there are only two side doors . SO my instructions were right this guy is just rude . Turns out he on the wrong street . HA . He read the address wrong . But that not where it ends . My soup is luke warm bland and we are missing a roll . I had to call back and have them deliver another one which took about 30 more minutes to be delivered . AND they charge me for it even though it was their mistake . In the past they have forgotten chopsticks and essentials . I m done with you Panda Wok . It is not hard to do your jobs . Clearly you just hired the wrong people to accurately take orders and deliver food to an address . Just because you are the only business in Lakewood offering this service does not give you an excuse to be shitty at it . ',\n",
       " '\"Never again ! \" - those are the words I angrily uttered after opening our package of food from UberEats . I gave this place 2 stars as opposed to 1 star because part of the MAJOR disappointment in the meal was due to my careless reading of their menu in the UberEats app . The description for pho said \"a huge bowl of rich beef pho broth served with rice noodles . . . blah blah\" Well dumb me I was not understanding that this pho comes with no meat at all - I just assumed that like typical pho it came with slices of raw beef . At no other Vietnamese restaurant will you get pho that is just plain broth with noodles . So I paid $8 for broth and a teeny bit of rice noodles and the garnishings (mint bean sprouts lime hot pepper) . On top of that the dang pho broth did not even taste that good ! I have a feeling that even if I had selected the additional add - on of $3 for smoked brisket I would have still been disappointed . Siggghhh . The garden rolls (springs rolls) were slightly better but only slightly . The cabbage they put in there was too bitter - those rolls are not typically made with red cabbage and now I can see why . It like this restaurant is updating traditional Vietnamese food just for the sake of innovation and being \"modern\" without stopping to consider whether it even an improvement in taste over the traditional way . Also on the service side they gave 2 options of peanut sauce or sweet chili sauce . I selected peanut sauce so of course what came in my order? You guessed it sweet chili sauce ! I m sad because this is one of the few options on UberEats . oh well now I know ! ',\n",

       " 'Brace yourself here comes a Chinese girl with a 3 star review ! LOL :P @ Tetsuro ! ! Anyways let me start off by saying that I have not been to a gelato specialty store in ages . Truthfully gelato has fallen off the trend ladder the past few years for my group . Now we are either getting fryo - yo or shaved ice . Now do not count me out just yet . I am not biased at all . It all about the taste to me . I had wanted to try Art of Flavors due to all the 5 star reviews . Speaking of which I feel like I m going to get jumped after this review HAHA ! Anywho my friends and I finally got to try out this place one Sunday afternoon . We were greeted by the site of a bunch of customers and a friendly face behind the counter . We never got his name but he was really friend . I think he was the husband? There were so many interesting flavors that I have never seen as gelato or ice cream . There was sweet corn pear and gorgonzola avocado etc . We even got to try a majority of the flavors and I suppose that where the magic ended for me . Oh no it was fabulous and fantastic service that we got to try so many flavors . In fact the man behind the counter was happy to oblige and started a conversation with us about the flavors . However it just did not captivate me . Regardless of all the interesting flavors and mixtures it did not get me . Everything tasted too milky and creamy . After every flavor I tried minus the sorbets the only thing I uttered after every flavor was \"milk\" . . . cause that was all I tasted . There may have been subtle hints of what the gelato SHOULD taste like but not enough to make itself known . Was there something wrong with my taste palette? Maybe . You could argue that point I suppose . However my friends agreed with me . Maybe I m just used to stronger flavors? Maybe I cannot do SUBTLE? Maybe I need it the flavors to PUNCH ME IN THE FACE? I do not know . Though I will say their sorbets are spectacular . The flavors were on point and tasted just like the real fruit . We tried the grapefruit and boy did it have the bitterness of the grapefruit . One of my friends and I ended up with a guava sorbet while my other friend got the avocado gelato . We have not had the chance to try anything other than their gelato but honestly I m not too sure if we will go back . A - okay in the end . Worth a try just to see all the different types of flavors . ',\n",

It rare that I see a security guard at the entrance to a burger joint but there one here and it appears he sampling what he paid to protect or at least paid to open the door for the crowds . I do not know if this is the best fast food burger on planet earth but it rivals any I have eaten at and I think I have tried most of the most popular ones at least once . There no doubt this is a popular walk up location and although the wait can be long the food will be served hot and fresh . The dine in area is relatively small but there are a few tables outdoors and also a concrete wall out front that some choose to take advantage of if this is an option you chose be prepared to share with the pigeons they are very friendly and bold so protect your burger and share your fries . . .

The tables were dirty so I cleaned one up with some napkins to sit at . The guy who took my order was friendly and helpful with questions I had about some of the drinks . My second visit I noticed they put a decent amount of tables and chairs outside making more room for customers which is nice . The one thing that was the same is the tables were dirty again . I had to clean a spot to sit and enjoy my coffee and breakfast not cool . If the tables are left dirty then how clean is the meal prep area? Also the same guy took my order on the second visit and he seemed more eager to chit chat with another guy that was working than he did about answering my questions about the latte art or menu items . Tiff Waffle Macchiato ($4 . 75 for a large) - Cinnamon vanilla macchiato whipped cream and a churro waffle . I loved this ! The drink tasted excellent and the churro waffle was very good ! Definitely try this one . Iced Honey Cream Latte ($4 . 65 for a large) - Honey steamed cream latte with a dash of nutmeg . I asked for this one iced and it tasted good and was a nice change from the same flavors I usually pick . I noticed they promote that they do latte art and so I asked the guy working about it . He said that only he and the owner Tiff know how to do the latte art right now until more people get trained and that you have to ask for it or your drink is marked to - go meaning it will be put in a to - go cup . It not like it makes the drink taste different but it is a nice touch and since this guy said he was one of the two who knew how to do it well it would have been nice of him to have done it . White Chocolate Mocha Latte ($4 . 65 for a large) - I asked for this one hot and it was like the previous drinks very good . Golden Waffle ($4) - This is a waffle with butter and powdered sugar . There is an option to add seasonal fruit for $1 extra so I did that . The waffle was hard and dry . I only made it through 3 bites and I was done . The seasonal fruit I added was sad looking and did not appear very fresh so I skipped on even trying any of it . Since the waffle I had with the coffee on my previous visit was so good I was disappointed with this one . I really liked the drinks a lot and they are 4 - 5 star worthy but my experience with the dirty tables waffle fruit breakfast and the inconsistent customer service leave me on the fence with this one .

All the other menu items are good if not great but as I say the eggplant is one of those dishes that makes me fantasize about it while I m eating my wife homemade cooking . I hate to admit it but TD has made me a food philanderer . As far as service ambiance and everything else who cares . When you love something as much as I love their eggplant dish the waiter could have servers Alzheimer my table could be in the middle of the parking lot and that idiotic Indian music could be blaring faux Barry Manilow .

The blackened salmon was baked to perfection drizzled in a butter sauce and topped with pico de gallo and sautéed shrimp . My order was for a half order which was about 6 ounces . The salmon was warm and flaky and the pico de gallo was cold and crisp . I thought the pico had too much cilantro which overpowered the salmon . There were about 8 nice sized shrimp on top of the salmon . The French fries were the frozen kind . The green beans were steamed until just cooked and coated with butter . This meal was a mixed bag of good and not so much . The salmon and green beans were prepared well the garnish and French fries not so much . The salad could have been the tipping point for another star but it was seriously average . My review for this restaurant is as well seriously average . ',\n",
       " 'Ahipoki opens its 9th locations in the valley and finally the one close to me ! Their first location in AZ opened just about a year ago that pretty fast to open 9 restaurants in one year . Nice to see more poke places in the valley . Since I had a bad experience in other location I was avoiding Ahipoki entirely for a while but I could not pass up there grand opening deal of 50% off ! Came in between lunch and dinner time to avoid any lines but they were not too busy at all . Friendly staff welcomed us immediately after walking in the same process of building your own bowl begun . I like their red pickles only available at Ahipoki chains . Side choice seemed less than other Ahipoki places but it could be only on grand opening day . This particular visit brought back faith in Ahipoki chain and since they are located on my way home from work I will be stopping by here more often',\n",

       " 'The hot dogs at any Toronto Vendor are way better and cheaper - with better service as well . I ordered the Buffalo hot dog and asked for it to be substituted with a chicken dog in place of the beef one . The cashier without issue processed my order but the hot dog chef (if you can call it that) and the condiment people made a huge fuss about my substitution . This is not Terroni there are no Hot Dog traditions give me my chicken hot dog . They gave in to my request but said they could not put all the condiments on the chicken dog that they would on the beef Buffalo dog . It was totally gross anyway i do not even think the extra condiments would have saved it . $8 . 00 for a gross hot dog . If you want a hot dog with the works bring some bacon and guacamole to your closest hotdog vendor i promise you will enjoy it much more than Franks and I just gave you an invisible Hot Dog Groupon to save $4 . 00',\n",
       " 'I was disappointed by this place . As a fan of Asian food I was excited to try an Asian Fusion restaurant near where I live . Their menu sounded good and their prices did not seem too bad . To begin with let me talk about the service . If it was an instagram post it would just say :#slow #stupid #shamefulOur waitress seemed like she had no clue what she was doing . And not because she was new . . . she just seemed clueless . This did result in an incorrect order and her not being able to answer any of the questions we had for her . We did ask her for recommendations but we got a simple \"Everything is good\" answer . (When I ask your opinion please do not give me a canned answer . I ask for a reason : because I want a real honest answer . )Secondly the food : It was okay . In my opinion for food supposed to be in possession of \"Asian flair\" this stuff was a little on the boring side of things . At least that what my taste buds registered . I m hoping we just caught the chef on an off night with an empty spice rack . Finally the prices . They were not bad they were not good . They were just fair . Had the food been what I would consider \"good\" rather than just \"meh\" the prices would seem even better . Would I come back here? I would consider revisiting if they shake things up a little . Would I recommend to others? Yes because I do not want my opinion to necessarily convince someone to not go to this place . You might like it . I would just recommend you not going with super high hopes for a fantastic meal . ',\n",
       " 'At long last I was able to check out Piedmont Social House after the Yelp event there ! Groupon had a sweet deal that included Bowling and shoes for four (one game - weekend costs a little extra) 2 Appetizers and 4 nonalcoholic drinks . Let me say this place looks totally different in the day ! Lots of light and a crazy amount of space ! The lanes here are new well - oiled and well maintained . The computer system has all sorts of additional features including bumpers that go up and down for kids . The bar(s) have a sweet selection of Draught Beers including 2 or 3 from NODA (Hop Drop and Roll me) . Prices are reasonable and there always some sort of drink special . Pool tables and video games upstairs . Fussball darts and lounge downstairs . The front end (the bowling part) and the bar were run pretty efficiently - our waiter lane side was nice enough but a little awkward handling the Groupon and not the best server (also forgot my to go drink I ordered) . The appetizers (pulled pork nachos and pretzels with beer cheese were both yummy - I just wished the portions were a bit bigger especially the four nachos . . . )We did have a blast ! Very family friendly until the clock strikes 8PM then it adults only ! Discount or not this place is pretty cool ! ',\n",
       " 'Usually when I wait more than a month or two to review a restaurant I usually just shelve that review until next time . I like the experience to be fresh in my head in order to properly rate it . With the Vegan brunch at Terrace Pointe one only needs to try it once to know it the most fabulous brunch you will find in Vegas . We wanted to splurge for a final meal in Vegas and why would not it be at Uncle Steve Vegan - friendly paradise of The Wynn?Sure $20 for Chicken and Waffles ai not no joke . Especially considering we have the best version of this back home in The East Bay Area at Hella Vegan Eats and Timeless Coffee for much less . Thankfully they are not serving up tiny foo foo portions here . No this is definite hangover food in size and taste . So much so that this was the only place in town that we needed a to go bag . The waffle was fantastic and I wish I knew how they got the coating so perfectly on the huge slab of Gardein . The Strawberry French Toast was a bit cheaper yet still pricey . This was my honey order yet I ended up eating more of it than she did . I m usually more of a savory vs sweet breakfast eater but if you are going the sweet route you cannot go wrong with this dish . The french toast was perfectly made in the \"I cannot believe it Vegan\" way . So light n fluffy you would never know unless someone told you . The reason my honey did not have room for all of her French Toast was the Blackberry Tart . We ordered that since we knew we would not be eating anywhere else that day . Not bad as these Wynn folks know their pastries pretty well . The homefries we got on the side were so so . They could have used more crisp to em . What I would not order is the side of Gardein sausage . Nothing special about it . In fact the two entrees were such good portions that this was overkill . Sure there are a few healthy Vegan entrees on the menu but you are not here for that . Just get the French Toast Chicken And Waffles It all you need to begin your day . The carafe of coffee that the friendly waitress left at the table was a nice old school diner touch that I was not expecting from such a $$$ place . Their uniforms were also very old school and ill fitting . I m not expecting cocktail waitress apparel but c mon Uncle Steve help these ladies out here ! Sure I could knock them on price . But you know what it Vegas . You do not come here because you are looking to save a few pennies . I would come here all over again as it was probably my favorite meal in town . Especially ever since the closing of Pura Vida . Brunch is the most important meal of the day other than maybe beer . Then again you need some food to soak up that booze and I cannot think of anywhere else I would rather start my day other than Terrace Pointe Cafe .

       " '\"Reputation is Everything . \"That is assuming it a good one which The Buffet at the Bellagio seems to still have (100 people waiting in line ! ) . It just a shame that the food cannot back that up anymore . While they were pretty darn good the last time I was here The Buffet now seems to be living off its reputation more than anything else . Although there were about 40 people in line when we arrived (it more than doubled by the time we left) we were able to bypass the wait by making a reservation . The trade off was a fixed 18% gratuity but it was well worth it to get in that much faster and to have all 12 of us seated together . Plus we probably would have tipped that much anyways . On the plus side there was a wide variety to choose from . Like nearly every other Vegas buffet there were sections for Asian food sushi sashimi seasonal fruits various salads pastas pizzas and seafood (including fresh king crab legs) . In addition they also had a couple of carvery stations offering meaty favorites like prime rib Kobe beef ribs pork belly and rack of lamb as well as stations for made - to - order tacos and caviar . And of course a dessert bar with a wealth of selections to cap your meal . While all that variety was great it was also necessary in order to find things worth eating . Most of the food was just okay with a handful of tasty items but the carvery meats were really disappointing though - the prime rib was okay and the rack of lamb was good but the Kobe beef was AWFUL (tough and flavorless) . Furthermore the tacos were pretty bleh two of the three caviars were just tobiko and ikura (like at Japanese restaurants) and the sashimi did not look appetizing at all . At $39 a head for a regular Saturday night dinner the price is comparable with the better buffets on the Strip (Wynn buffet and Cosmo Wicked Spoon for two) but the food felt like it was a step or two behind . TWO AND A HALF STARS rounded up because things like the salmon mousse cups smoked salmon chocolate covered strawberries and rack of lamb were \"plus\" items . Plus a part of me just hopes that it was a bad night . However if I had to paid out of my pocket (the resort credit I got for staying at the Bellagio covered my meal) I would have rounded down .

       " 'I first heard about Yum Yum BBQ from a friend . She said it was cheap and good so i thought what could go wrong there? The first time I went there I ordered the crispy tempura roll and the BBQ chicken plate . These dishes were good and made me want to come back for more . The second time I went to Yum Yum in 2009 I finally noticed that they had an \"all you can eat\" menu . The price for the ability to eat all the sushi rolls and Hawaiian foods that you wanted was an automatic steal . In 2009 the price for the \"all you can eat\" menu was a dollar or two cheaper like it really makes a huge difference . Along with the \"all you can eat\" there is the \"all you can drink\" option which allows you to get unlimited sodas or bottled waters from their fridge . One soda or bottle of water usually costs around 1 . 50 - 2 . 00 dollars so you might as well add on the \"all you can drink\" option for another 2 - 3 dollars extra . The first time I ordered the \"all you can eat\" I brought along 5 of my friends to try it with me . They were here visiting from San Francisco and of course just wanted to eat eat and eat . I thought it was a good way to take a break from all the ordinary Las Vegas buffets . We were amazed at all the food options listed on the \"all you can eat\" menu . There was Hawaiian food such as chicken katsu BBQ chicken spam masubi etc . There was Japanese food such as the MANY types of sushi rolls they offer (One of my favorite parts about this menu since regular sushi rolls in other restaurants sell for 8 - 12 dollars) . And there was also delicious Korean BBQ . I definitely suggest the short ribs (kalbi) . Every year when my friends come to visit me Yum Yum BBQ is always on the list of places to eat at here in Las Vegas . I m sure the waiter who is always there knows us by now . He is really nice and has lots of patience when serving a group of people who are all hungry for their yummy dishes . Oh and I forgot to add that you can only order 2 dishes at a time but since it is a small usually non - busy place you will be able to get your order pretty fast . ',\n",

Without a doubt a cute shop with friendly service provided by a young lady named Brenda it was just after 7 :00pm when I walked into the small store and with a short line fronted by a woman and her daughter planning a Sweet 16 party I spent some time perusing the items and chatting with other customers seemingly each with a different favorite amongst the store nearly twenty options . Featuring plated desserts custom cakes jars cookies and other take - home treats it was with an eye on variety that I ordered when I approached the front of the line and self - selecting a few favorites along with two selections confirmed by Brenda to be as good as the crowd had suggested I made my way to the door immediately indulging in a buttery cinnamon - laced snickerdoodle with crispy edges and a soft center the first of a half dozen + 1 items tallying $25 after tax and tip . Showing some restrained and retaining the rest of my purchase for the twenty - seven minute drive home it was with coffee in hand that I continued my tasting first with a bananas - foster - esque cupcake that was plenty moist but somewhat marred by overly sweet frosting but moving on to the dense peanut butter blondie things improved substantially the dense square loaded with rich chocolate tones and roasted organic peanut butter a classic combo only improved after a minute on a warm skillet . Moving finally to what has seemingly become LoVullo ignature item it was with a quartet of macarons that I rounded out my evening and with each palm - sized cookie featuring a characteristic crackle over rich flavors the texture of the crmb was actually far more dense than the Parisian classic - a moist cake - like consistency akin to the American whoopie pie and although perhaps not traditional entirely delicious - both the dense chocolate dipped Snickers and rich savory Fig and Goat Cheese \"Whooparons\" undoubtedly justifying the nearly hour - long round trip . . . though if they ever decide to expand I definitely see a market for a second shop in ever trendy Summerlin .

Luckily I get to get back to Vegas regularly so I can stuff my face . Why do I love Cap ? Here why :1 . The sandwiches are super duper amazingly tasty . Everything I have tried is amazing but I usually go for the classic Bobbie (with extra mayo of course) or a Cheesesteak with mushrooms (and more mayo . ) . They are yummy filling and mouth watering . FYI for anyone who does not know what the Bobbie is it is Thanksgiving in a roll . Roasted turkey cornbread dressing home made cranberry sauce and some mayo on a flaky roll . It also goes by \"Heaven on a Bun\" in many circles . 2 . You usually get great customer service . It seems you have to be rad to work at a Cap . Happy people + Good customer service = Lotsa repeat customers . 3 . Did I mention my love for the Bobbie with extra mayo????Capriotti is just a fantastic sandwich shop with great food . If you have not tried them yet go to one ASAP ! As for my 4 star rating it is because of the physical location . This parking lot is a hot mess at all times of the day . This is probably because of the LVAC gym located in the same area but it is still a pain to get in and out easily . You are risking your life trying to walk around and risking your car from the crazy drivers . I rarely go to this location for this very fact . ',\n",
       " 'For my 1000th review I would like to talk about something I just love and crave - crawfish . Those that know us they know we just love seafood and we were regulars among the crawfish circuit . However we took a little break after having Little Guy and Little Gal because it just hard to get down and dirty when you have two kids with you . But we are back . . . and hitting the crawfish cravings hard ! We are always open to healthy competition among our old favorites and standbys and gave Smokin Crawfish a go . The crawfish was exceptionally clean which is something we really appreciate and the flavoring is good . I m all about some serious good head juice and their crawfish has it good - so sweet and oh so yum ! (Smokin Style and mild is our current flavor profile and we only order crawfish . ) After getting our initial fix here we went back to our old place the following week and just found ourselves wanting more Smokin instead . And so we came back again and again . We were there on a weekly basis for awhile which is a big deal when you get limited date nights . We even returned despite the Husband getting some Smokin Style juice straight into the eye and having a major Hitch moment . (Not a pretty sight shall I say and pretty scary for a moment there too . ) Two pounds of crawfish will get you a potato and corn thrown in but we usually opt for all potatoes . We also like to do two pounds at a time so the crawfish stays nice and hot and we can pace ourselves . I crave crawfish these days and we cannot wait until we get our date nights to get down and dirty there . Plus their music choice just rocks when I m there ! I find myself grooving when I m eating and it probably because I m just so happy eating crawfish again . But they have some serious TV action happening here so we can easily catch up on our favorite sport teams while we grub too . Parking is easy breezy here which is a major plus . They have some nice happy hour deals on beer buckets which I notice are quite popular . In the back there a lobster claw machine where you can win a lobster for $2 . If you catch it they will cook it ! ',\n",

I bought a groupon thinking it would be a great experience while my husband and I and another couple visited las vegas . In the print in the groupon it says only one groupon per party so we were all four well aware that we would probably have to sit at seperate tables while we dined so we could take advantage of both groupons . So we made reservations took a cab for $30 . 00 to this place ( take note this place is off the strip and first pulling up looks like a hole in the wall grungy not nice as you would expect from a brazillian restaruant )We then proceeded to tell the employees that we have a groupon and would be sitting at different tables different checks etc . About a minute passed after we were sat when a gentleman I presume must have been the owner came up and told us he could not let us use both groupons because we are the same party . At the point I said \"we are not the same party we are seperate tables seperate bills im not even sitting with them at the same tables\" I am not exaggerrating when I say that this business owner or whoever he was sat there and argued with me and told us that he saw us come in together same cab and although we are at different tables because of the fact we know eachother he will not let us use our groupons . He also proceeded to ask me like im some idiot \" can you not understand me let me explain this to you . \" he even printed out the groupon to show me it has to be seperate parties .

       " 'Funny story : in 2007 I went on a blind date to Social House when it was operated by someone else in TI . The guy insisted on ordering for me : sunomono (cucumber) salad (the size of a soy sauce dish) and 1 order of tamago (egg) sushi that he split with me . No joke ! We sat outside and that was my first view of the siren show ugh . After that I tore off to Godiva in Fashion Show and bought myself chocolate . Good riddance . Fast forward Social House left TI and I forgot about it . Then I was in Crystals one day walking around and saw an ad for desserts in restaurants there . The yuzu frangipane called my name . Last night Eric R . and I attended a really cool event at Social House in Crystals . It was a sake lesson from a sake sommelier paired with different bites from the food menu . First we had junmai premium sake paired with yellowtail sashimi with tempura jalapeno garlic dust tiny cilantro and calamansi soy . Did someone say tempura jalapeno slices? Yes indeedy . Next we sampled another sake some higher level paired with big eye tuna sashimi sweet chili sauce crispy shallot red onion and negi oil . The next dish was amaaaaazing : nasu spicy miso : small delicate roasted Japanese eggplant with spicy miso glaze . This was truly delicious ! ! ! Our last dish was a set of rolls : salmon avocado hama - chimi (hamachi avocado jalapeno - cilantro chimichurri garlic chips) and negi toro (fatty tuna with green onion) . Our final sake was Ty - Ku coconut flavored nigori (unfiltered) . This was actually really delicious . I have long been a coconut fan but I am on a huge coconut kick lately . This one is worth purchasing and I can get it at Total Wine or Lee according to the sommelier . This ended up being a really fun event . At the end I ordered the yuzu frangipane which is made to order because it is a molten cake ! Warm almond cake molten yuzu cream cheese filling raspberry sorbet almond toffee and fresh raspberries . It was tasty more like almond than yuzu . The idea of it is really good but I am looking for yuzu to punch my taste buds so this in the end was not quite yuzu - y enough for me :) and it cost $12 . Anyway I would come back for some bites here especially that eggplant ! ',\n",

       " 'I went to this festival for the first time this year and had a good time . I think the organizers may have addressed at least some of the issues that were present in previous years . There were a lot of free samples this year and I did not feel like the crowds were out of control for the most part . The line was long for a couple of very popular vendors but most of the vendors I was able to walk right up to or had only a short wait . You still definitely want to get in line early for the very popular food trucks booths since they will run out of items before the day is over . I think the price of admission should be $15 - 20 for General Admission instead of $25 or they should include a couple more freebies with General Admission . I noticed a lot of the VIP bags were not even picked up by 4pm . Maybe next year offer free goodie bags to the first 500 people?My favorite things were the Mustache Mocha from Pour Jo Coffee the Soybean Bao from Hot Bamboo the microgreens from YoBro and the cool vegan buttons sold in the apparel booth . I do agree with other reviewers that the organizers should reach out to Follow Your Heart Tofurky etc . to have booths here and offer free samples and coupons . A decent amount of non - vegans also come to these festivals so it still worth it for the major vegan brands to be represented here . I also liked the location of the festival and thought it was a good choice . However the recycling and trash bins were confusing to tell apart so that is something that can be improved for next year . Overall a great time though and I m happy I came ! ',\n",
       " 'A quintessential experience on a holiday to Vegas is a visit to a buffet . We do not really anything on this scale in the UKThe MGM Grand hosts one of the bigger buffets in town . The fiancée and I settled on this as we were hungry and truth be told we could not be bothered to walk back down to the other restaurants in the MGM - these Vegas casinos are hugeWe happened to visit on crab legs night one of the more expensive evenings . A tip for you - if you are not sure how to get full value on anything just follow the crowd of Asians . We are super thrifty and love getting value for moneyI did eat my share of seafood . Once I tore myself away from the seafood area there were stations serving lovely prime rib and other cooked meats . I do not think you can eat everything even if you only took one of each thingYou should head here if you are in town and looking for a typical Vegas experience',\n",
       " 'Some friends and I went to to Sky for my girlfriends birthday . Now granted I am way cooler than these guys and hang out with them mostly so I can be seen as charitable . Appearances are important as we all know . We started with the vegetable tempura and I must say it was pretty darn good not the best I have had but pretty pretty good . I was able to order my dinner despite being oggled by the entire staff guests at other tables even my friends . In the midst of carrying the conversation and being completely fascinating and not to mention soul shatteringly attractive I was able to order the sushi combination . The sushi was insanely fresh ! It honestly was more than I expected . Being an awesome boyfriend(probably the best ever) I agreed to eat some of my girlfriends dragon roll it was awesome . Simply the best dragon roll I have ever eaten . And let me tell you sister I have eaten many a dragon roll . The service was on par and the place was clean . The staff was very pleasant . My only beef was that the decor seemed a bit confused but that is a minor issue when compared to the painfully delicious sushi I shoved into my stupid face that night ',\n",

Not only did the hostess bombard us almost beg us to sit at a table and not the bar so the servers could make money . . . . but with less than 5 minutes of the game left all of the wait staff screamed at us to get out . Saying \"you have two minutes and then we are taking your drinks . \" Very disappointed and upset almost embarrassed about this evening . Will be a very long time before we return . . . . lost a few loyal customers tonight . ',\n",
       " 'It was another guys night out with fellow Baristas . We have been talking about it for quite some time and decided to try it out . I personally knew about it but never got the chance to try it out even though their first Vegas location in Downtown Summerlin is much closer to my house . Upon entering the first impression was the similarities with Yard House and Claim Jumper with a rustic log cabin setting . A cool thing about Lazy Dog is the seating arrangement makes it ideal for large groups . We had the pleasure of being served by Heather . She was very engaging and service was on point . The food was not mind blowing but good comfort food . A good option for a large group since there is good variety of food from Italian to Asian dishes to please everyone . For starters we got the Cajun Fries . It was good just a tad bit on the salty side but the Chipotle Ranch dipping sauce was pretty good . Another appetizer we got was the Ahi Poke Jar which was by far the dish we enjoyed the most . The fresh Ahi Tuna was balanced and flavorful with peanut like dressing and paired with crispy wonton chips was a cool concept from your usual spinach artichoke dishes at other chain restaraunts . A few of us got pastas one got an Asian dish and myself went for the Sriracha Chicken Sandwich . We enjoyed everything including the fact we had a few drinks and shots with our meals to De - Stress from a week of working . Overall we had a great time . A cool place to hangout with friends . There is a saying that it always about \"Timing . \" A cool thing happen on this particular night 12 . 4 . 16 when our group was included in a company wide mannequin challenge which we all decided to hop on and was added to the video shoot . We were able to view the video and was told that it will be posted on Lazy Dog social media platform . So were hoping it will go viral ! :) Diffenitely will be back ! ',\n",
       " 'Eat local ! ! Eat Mexican ! ! LOL ! The review Patty left is crazy because I had the complete opposite encounter . We went in around 1 :30 and there are only two ladies working the cook and the server . She told us hello and to sit wherever we wanted . We sat and she came up and spoke to us in a friendly manner we order WATER HORCHATA and some Mexican cokes . A few minutes later she came out with all of our drinks and took our order . I ordered a carne asada gordita sans beans and some fries and my BF orders a Cali burrito . Now Yelp guidelines are pretty . . . flexible I never cuss in my reviews but an email I received said they like for the reviewers to express their passion so I m going to do just that . THE CARNE ASADA IS MOTHERFUCKING AMAZING . IT S THE BEST FUCKING CARNE ASADA to come out of a little shop . It HELLA FUCKING better than Tacos el Gordo and any other carne asada out of a small resto just blows dicks compared to this one ! And guess what? You want fucking taco Tuesday? or like us beaners taco any day? Come here ! Tacos are 1 . 35$ wait bitch did you just say $1 . 35?? For a fucking street taco? ! YAAAASSS BITCH ! Come get some delicious juicy meat in a small tortilla and put that shit down your throat just like some other meat you booches ! Anyway out food was super delicious and priced oh so right . You definitely get your fill . Burritos are huge just like my boyfriends . . . dimples . And the gordita is just like me juicy and delicious . One will def do ! The free chips and beans are a nice touch ! This is not some opulent resto this is a mom and pop owned hole in the wall . Do not expect a cloth napkin and them to lick your ass . Support them ! Also Patty I did not see any self serve water areas . . . stay off that yayo girl ! LOLYay ! ',\n",
       " 'I spent the morning at Bunna Coffee and stayed through today Yelp Office Hours . I was super impressed with the number of are gulars in the place and how most of them were known by name . The atmosphere is welcoming the coffee is fabulous and the food is fresh ! I had a big bowl of fresh berries (blueberries blackberries and strawberries) granola (some of the best I have had ever) and organic yogurt along with a cup of sumatra (medium roast) coffee with some steamed almond milk on the side . That was the fuel that got me through my morning . I am happy to see a local business thriving (or at least it appears that way) . I wish Bunna was a tad bit closer to where I live because I would like to be a regular there too ! ',\n",
       " 'Review #500 ! Yay Me ! :PLucki Thai is located near the corner of Bermuda and Silverado Ranch Blvd right next to the Fresh and Easy location . We have been to South Point more and more lately and wanted to find a new Thai place to try out in the area . After checking on our trusty Yelp ! app . we found this place ! Items Ordered : - Chicken Pad See Ewe ($8 . 95) - Pork Laab (I guess I have been misspelling this \"Larb\" recently . . . oops my bad) ($8 . 95) - Side order of jasmine rice ($1 . 50)( + ) Very friendly and attentive service ! Never had to see our drinks empty the entire time we were there ! Chicken Pad See Ewe (4 5) For the price a very solid portion that was very tasty . Plenty of chicken too ! Jasmine Rice (3 . 5 5) Kind of hard to mess this up but they did good ! Rice was the perfect combination of sticky and fluffy . Pork Laab (5 5) Best Laab I have had in this country ! Seriously prepared exactly how I love it ! Plentiful portion as well ! I will be ordering this dish often ! ( - ) Only complaints with this place was that the seat was wet when I sat down today and there were a couple small dried food fragments on one of the plates already at the table when we sat down . I just decided to not use that plate but still not something you wish to see when you are just sitting down at a dining establishment . I like this little place a lot ! The people are nice and the food is really good and all that at an affordable price ! With our recent patronage at South Point I can see myself coming back here again and again ! 4 stars . ',\n",
       " 'Just happened to catch their signage while driving past their location on W Flamingo and Durango . I noticed the \"Bowl\" and thought it might have been another new Poké \"Bowl\" place that is the latest food trend in Vegas and many of the western states . Or a retro hair salon featuring vintage \"Bowl\" cuts that some of us sported in the 70s and 80s . Thank heaven it is actually a trendy Asian fusion restaurant and not the latter . Bowl Tique Avenue actually have their menu on the BeyondMenu App which I was prompted to download when I tried to look at what they offered . Pretty high tech and it is the first business that I know that accepts Apple Pay (which Yelp has been asking about for awhile when I check in to businesses) . So while I pulled over about two giant blocks down the door and studying their menu I decided to give them a try and also test drive the BeyondMenu App . The ordering process is super easy just select the item and the quantity and add it to the cart . If your total reach a certain threshold for using their online coupon on BeyondMenu the app will prompt you for the option to use it . Very user friendly ! ! ! The Chinese cooks (possibly the users) were preparing my order of their Signature Fried Rice side orders of Grilled Chicken Thigh and Pork Tenderloin . As a young Caucasian waitstaff greeted me and handed me one of the menu which he explained has additional coupons that is not on the BeyondMenu App . I also learned that the very modern and clean restaurant that sports an open kitchen design just opened last Sunday so they are pretty much off the radar being in business for just 6 days . As I was planning to watch a few episodes of HGTV Fixer Upper I had my order to go and payment was done when I placed the order through the app . But the restaurant decor is very pleasant and the dining room fairly large that I would enjoy dining in the next time I am in the mood for a different kind of Chinese take out . The fried rice I ordered was very large . Easily enough to share between two adults with normal appetite . The Grilled Chicken was prepared nicely and seasoned just right and would totally be the perfect lazy way to meal prep you of your proteins . The Pork Tenderloin appeared to be prepared Chinese style with velveting of the meat so it is tender and moist . Overall I thought the guest service experience is very good . Immediately after handing my to go order the young waitstaff headed for the exit to open the door and wish me a pleasant evening (simple courteous gestures that are very typical of traditional Japanese restaurants) which I have yet to experience at any Chinese takeout restaurants . The food was good nothing fancy but certainly hit the spot twice over . Being so close to where I live I will likely head back and give other menu items a try (like their noodles or fried pork cutlet) . 4 stars . ',\n",
       " 'I love this place ! The girls are hot and the beer is cold . The girls are fun and do fun stuff . I cannot even believe its legal ! My only complaint is that my wife found the seat of my truck covered in stripper glitter . They need to install some sort of vacuum system in the parking lot to avoid such disasters . ',\n",
       " 'Archi is a Las Vegas Thai chain with 3 locations and I must admit that a recent obsession with Thai Noodle had caused me to forget about how much I do enjoy some curry and noodles at Archi particularly at my neighborhood location . When we first moved to town Archi was our go to spot for Thai . The food can be great which I will get to later but I think what distinguishes Archi from most restaurants in Las Vegas is their interior . They have done a brilliant job transforming a strip mall space into a warm clean and welcoming space . There is a coherent sense of design which puts me at ease for some reason . Maybe it just makes me feel like Archi has a good handle on things . And he does ! After being a little Thai adventurous and eating all around town I can confidently say that when the food is good it is really good . Granted they do suffer from inconsistency from time to time and their spice scale baffles me . A 3 can be mind - blowingly hot despite the fact that the scale supposedly goes to 10 . Consider yourself warned . Despite that when I want curry or Pad Kee Mow or a very respectable eggplant dish I am happy to visit Archi . The tofu in their stir - fry and noodle dishes is not the most flavorful but I was obsessed with their Pad Kee Mow for at least a month . I became a little frustrated when the vegetable selection kept changing . How hard is it to give a girl a solid helping of real vegetables (baby corn does not count) with her noodles? However on my last visit I told the waitress \"lots of yummy vegetables please\" and apparently that is the secret phrase to unlock garden delight because I got mega - veggies . Splendid ! The service has always been no - water - glass - empty amazing when I have visited . Food comes out quickly and hot . Servers are always nice . I was teetering between a 3 and a 4 for Archi but Archi I am slapping a 4 on your establishment because although the food is a little inconsistent I really really appreciate the atmosphere cleanliness and service and when the curry stars align the food is definitely fan worthy .

       " 'I get heartburn sometimes . Some pizza will give me heartburn . Euro Gyro gave me such bad heartburn I threw up . The pizza is not bad . It is typical NE Ohio hillbilly pizza but with some garlic crust . The Guy on the Couch sandwich was my friend Stoner Jon favorite . He would always order it drunk while living in the dorms . There would always be empty beers and the remains of the Guy on the Couch laying on his floor on a Friday Saturday or Sunday morning . Euro Gyro always seemed like a great idea late at night was a regret in the morning . ',\n",

It took us almost an hour to get here driving the place had 3 huge black metal BBQ pits . With tons of chopped wook . 2 doors one to come in to the place one door to exist and guess which one we used to enter? Correct your are the exit door do not blame us please there were no signs . All the customers from all 5 tables yelled wrong door get out get out . So we did and we used the other door yes thank you God we are in . You order your food either by the pound or as a sandwich standing up not seated So we got 2 pounds of Beef Brisket Potato salad and beans . Arizona ice tea to drink and a Cactus drink . They had three different BBQ . Sauces Original Spicy and A Mustard BBQ sauce . Let me tell you this place Food Service Location Hours (11_4) is all unique and worth a visit . All the employees are wonderful Especially Seath . If you like beef Ribs come on Saturday . I recommend to Seath that they should open another location with more tables or maybe not because this is what makes Miss BBQ so unique . ',\n",
       " 'When I heard \"Chick - fil - A on crack\" the chicken sandwich at Honey Salt shot to the top of my gotta - try immediately list . I grew up in Georgia so I grew up on the fil - A (wheat bun extra pickles) . I have even been to a Dwarf House . With two golden - fried chicken breasts slaw special sauce and pickles the sandwich absolutely did not disappoint me . Sure it was a bit intimidating when it arrived in all of its 6 - inch tall grandeur but I gave it a good squeeze cut it in half and immediately devoured every last bite . It had a winning combination of sweet and sour and the chicken was nice and juicy . For $13 I would definitely order it again and again . It is served with a side chopped salad that has some unexpected ingredients including kale . In case you were wondering I ate every last bite of that too . The restaurant is open airy and rustic . I cannot get enough of such inspired spots . From the chairs to the napkins you can definitely see that there is passion for what is being executed . It is perfect for lunch dates moms first dates and more . The also have patio dining but you cannot have alcohol outside . Service may have been a tad slow but I think that will improve with time . I have also had the opportunity to sample a couple of other things and from those I would also recommend the scallops (the truffles really work in this dish) the curry (a sweeter variety but good) and the tuna crudo as a starter . We will be back . Next on my list to try : Midnight Rambler . (It their bourbon cocktail . )',\n",
       " 'I begin this review with a confession : I AM THE WORST ! Going out to eat with me is like being in a Portlandia sketch : \"I m not doing dairy soy or wheat these days . And I m really trying to stay away from nuts . \" \"Is that organic? Is it local?\" \"Do you have a vegan option?\"Needless to say quick - service grab - and - go dining is a minefield for me . So I m giving Root Café 5 stars right off the bat for being a place that I can come for breakfast lunch or dinner and make absolutely ZERO dietary compromises ! On a recent trip I sampled a Fig Orange muffin that in addition to being DELICIOUS and house - made was also gluten - free soy - free and vegan . The espresso roast I was served from Rising Star (love) was brewed to perfection . It was a perfect breakfast . I have also partaken in their house - made burritos soup and hot breakfast options all of which have been prepared and presented beautifully . Were they the best thing I have ever tasted? Maybe not . But everything was fast tasty well - priced and as healthful well - sourced as one can dream of in a café service setting . Come here to have a quick snack that you can feel good about . Stay for the bustling energy and distinctive flavor of Lakewood . Thank you Root Café for being a haven for the demanding eater ! Keep it up ! ',\n",

They truly have some of the best salads around - they are packed with all kind of goodies and definitely wo not leave you hungry .

There is a place just like this in New York City but the prices are triple so I have never gone . This place is serving some awesome options for your PB&J cravings . Upon entering I was greeted by the owner . She and her brother run the business together . Hooray ! They have a family friend who makes the peanut butter and homemade dog treats . There are tons of flavors of jelly and a variety of toppings . You can get PB&J sushi Build - Your - Own Gourmet sandwiches Grilled cheese and Cereal . Nothing here is terribly complicated which is nice when life is stressful . I tested out the Apple Jack Sandwich ($3 . 25) and Blueberry Yum Yum Roll ($3 . 75) . My favorite was the roll which was crunchy peanut butter and blueberry jelly topped with blueberries and vanilla drizzle . The blueberry jelly was awesome . This combination was delicious and just the right amount of sweet . The Apple Jack was good too . It was smooth peanut butter Apple butter and apple slices on Cinnabon bread . I could not really taste the Apple butter but I liked this sandwich too . It tastes like fall . I will definitely stop back in on my next trip through Bloomfield . To be honest I do not know how sustainable the store is since the prices are so low and rent must be fairly high . I hope they manage to hang in there ! ! I also would love it if they sold their jelly as well . Credit accepted . ',\n",
       " 'One of the most spectacular spectacles that Vegas has to offer : and it free ! ! ! Currently at least . I m sure there some greedy little casino execs in some small room somewhere trying to think of some way to keep the general public out and charge Bellagio prices to view it . Probably all out of spite because they are 40 year old virgins and even the Vegas escorts turn them down . Definitely catch at least one of the shows because it is amazing and you never know when they will pull the plug on it . Vegas does not give a GFE anymore . They want your money and that that . Also consider dining at one of the waterfront restaurants inside Bellagio during the evening and you will get to see the various fountain shows . It a must do . ',\n",
       " 'I was really worried coming here for brunch . It was like seeing a friend after a very long time . You are pretty sure you are still going to like them but something could go terribly wrong and you will be disappointed at the hope of a long lasting relationship . Kaya is my go to joint for happy hour . Hands down they have thee best happy hour in the city . I mean half off EVERYTHING ! Even shots (okay things get a little crazy when you enter that into the equation) . And of course if you are drinking it up you also have to get some nourishment . Coming here so much I have gone down the menu with my meals and not - a - one has let me down ! All amazing . . . Big shout out to the Fish Tacos . I would heard how good brunch was but I really wanted it to live up to the normal Kaya standard . You can see why I would be nervous . If they ruined something as sacred as brunch what would be left? Maybe I m being too dramatic because you know I would be back at that bar once it hit 5pm but still . . . I was expecting a stellar meal . I m happy to report they delivered and then some ! There were a handful of items that stood out to me but the Salmon Eggs Benedict was the true winner . I believe the key item being corn bread instead of a biscuit . LOVED . IT . Every bite . The cornbread made the dish but the hollandaise was a close second (you cannot mess with a good sauce ! ) . Eggs were perfect and salmon was smokey . The side dishes held their own with juicy sweet sauteed pineapples and a spicy potato hash . I really wanted to lick my plate clean . They can do no wrong in my book . Come for brunch stay for lunch and exit after dinner . You will probably want to throw up after a full day spent eating and drinking at Kaya but it will have been worth it I swear ! ',\n",

       " 'Laissez les bons temps rouler ! To the non - native New Orleans peeps \"Let the good times roll ! \" That is exactly what Streetcar Po boys is doing with their new restaurant here in Vegas . I actually grew up in New Orleans the West Bank if you are interested so I consider myself an expert in NOLA food . I remember eating po boys at least once a week when we lived there because they are just what everyone eats . Why because NOLA po boys are AWESOME ! So when I heard about Streetcar Po boys I had to get down there and check it out ASAP . I found some great things happening as well . Here whats up :This little hole in the wall joint is totally legit when it comes to New Orleans style po boys . They have all of the NOLA po boy norms like shrimp catfish oyster muffaletta and boudin options on the menu for those who want an authentic NOLA meal . They also have non - NOLA options like grilled cheese BBQ pork chicken parm and tuna salad just to name a few . This is great because no matter who you are with the will definitely find something they will like to try . The ingredients are super fresh and many are flown in from Louisiana . The french bread is from Leidenheimer Baking Company in New Orleans which is THE bread that made po boys famous . It is delicious french bread that has a fantastically flaky crust and fluffy soft insides . The boudin sausage is from Lafayette LA which is right in the middle of Cajun Country and where the best boudin is made . The shrimp they use are the wonderfully gorgeous Gulf shrimp . Yum ! The sandwiches all come \"dressed\" unless otherwise stated . This is straight out of NOLA and how you order sandwiches everywhere you go . Dressed means to have lettuce tomatoes and mayo on your sandwich . Very nice touch to thrown in that saying . They also have tasty sides to go with your sandwich . Each po boy comes with Cajun Chips which are house made potato chips with a yummy Cajun seasoning coating them . They are really quite good if I say so myself . You also get to pick an additional side like french fries hush puppies mac n cheese beer battered onion rings to name a few . Oh the desserts ! Again Streetcar is doing it right with their dessert menu . They have all of the NOLA favorites I loved growing up as a kid like bananas foster bread pudding cheesecake and KING CAKE . I think this is the only place in Vegas I have ever seen King cake on the menu . And drumroll please . . . . . . They make Beignets in house ! Fresh Beignets any time of day is a dream come true right there ! Drool . . . . . This is a family run place as well . Gwen the owner is almost always there . She is a true delight ! She came up to us before we were even seated . As soon as she opened her mouth we all knew that accent ! She from NOLA and proud of it ! She is a lovely Southern belle that knows her po boys ! She was so friendly and went out of her way to make us feel welcome . We talked to her on and off the entire meal and just had a blast . She deserves a star all unto herself ! The only \"Eh\" issue I had was the sweet tea cups . They use really small cups for their tea . 2 sips and your cup was empty . Bigger tea cups would be great improvement . Other than that this place ROCKS MY SOCKS OFF ! I was so happy after my first visit . I cannot wait to go back and try a dozen more po boys ! Really if you like po boys or just want to try something new get down to Streetcar Po boys because your belly will love you for it ! ',\n",

And the fried chicken are like nuggets that were not at all special ; sauce left a lot to be desired . The sushi was overpriced like everything else and had way too much going on . Could not taste the fish as they had so many other seasonings and flavors overpowering the fish - but then again that may not have been so bad given the other flavors w the broth and fried chicken . I was not expecting NYC - esque noodle house but close since it stated they make their noodles in - house . Service was also slow . And it was not even crowded . We went on a late Sunday afternoon . Overpriced and salty is what I chalk this up to . ',\n",

Easily found a parking spot so I had a good feeling it might not be that bad but then saw a mass of people outside then a mass of people inside . Uh oh . . . its got to be a 45 minute wait and I m starving so I started to think of where else to go as I approached the hostess stand . \"It will be about 10 - 15 minutes\" she said . Wow ! And it was about 10 minutes . This place knows how to move people in and out fast . Within mere seconds of sitting down a waitress drops off the 24 hour menus and takes a quick drink order . I ordered the eggs benedict and my friend buffalo wings extra hot . Food was out in about 10 minutes . Eggs benedict comes with 3 poached eggs over two English muffins and a side of potatoes . All was cooked great . Hollandaise sauce was a bit lacking in flavor though . I will give the food 3 stars . Nothing special . My friend said her wings were not that spicy . They were pretty good sized though . Overall the service is what makes this place special along with the cool decor . While sitting there we were approached for bar drinks twice and a free photo which I doubt is actually free . My first time here I had a chicken fried steak which was pretty decent but the eggs benedict were not all that this time so I will try another meal next time I m back . ',\n",

Once you choose your toppings the pizza goes in the oven and a few minutes later a server calls you to the counter to retrieve your pizza . I was there during the lunch rush and the staff seemed to be very efficient . The one thing that sets this place apart from Blaze is the sauce . The organic red sauce is outstanding ! !

They cut the crab legs in half the meat at the carving station was salty and just about every other item I tried was either too bland or had a BAD taste . I wish I would have gotten the waiter name because his service sucked . After being seated he neglected our table for about 15 minutes so we finally flagged someone down to help us then they pointed that the guy who was neglecting our table was our waiter . He came over to our table and acted as if he did not want to even want to be bothered with us .

There was about a 20 minute wait to be seated . Once you pay ($30pp for lunch + tip) you are led to a table in the cavernous dining room . You serve yourself drinks from a Coke freestyle machine or juice fountains . There are several different types of cuisine with some inspiration from the Bellagio restaurants . One thing you should try is the Hawaiian ice cream - refreshing and delicious ! Sadly the rest of food was average and lacked any originality . Nothing stood out as noteworthy and I regret not just going to a brunch restaurant . I am not even sure if this buffet would compare well to similar Vegas buffets . Maybe Bellagio buffet was better back in the day or maybe my expectations have been raised over the years . . . but this is not the meal i remember ! ',\n",

When I came here no one was waiting in line so I did not feel like I was rushed at all . The staff members were super friendly and offered to help if I had any questions . When I was ready to order the Yelp check in was a little glitchy but the staff was super patient and offered to use their phone to show me how it works . I ordered the Toronto bowl and it $12 . 18 for this poke bowl if you do the Yelp check in ! ! Thank you poke wrap for this delicious poke bowl ! The staff asked me if I wanted the jalapeno in my poke bowl and how much I wanted cause the Toronto bowl includes that option which I thought was super thoughtful because a lot of people might not even ask . This was a massive bowl to start off with - it was the regular size (I think that pretty standard for a lot of poke places) . The fish was extremely fresh and they came in large pieces which I enjoyed compared to the small pieces . Poke wrap was really delicious I think next time I come back I will share this massive bowl with a friend ! ',\n",
       " 'Brunch : Making morning binge drinking seem classy since forever . I woke up this morning checked my texts and suddenly I m at brunch with the guys and a boy [the cutest 4 - month old baby boy at that ! ] . Everybody ordered their food some bussers knocked over a huge trashcan and suddenly champagne bottles were rolling across the floor . Surprisingly the baby does not cry . Phew . Our hostess was pretty unfriendly but the waitress was a peach ! I had ordered The Cali Eggs Benedict [bacon grilled tomato avocado topped with hollandaise and includes breakfast potatoes . $12 . 25] and it was alright . The hollandaise was creamy and smooth but lacking that lemon juice tangy tartness . Still though those eggs were poached beautifully . The bacon was also pretty fantabulous and cooked perfectly . As for a random wedge of avocado on the side it kind of felt like they forgot to put the avocados on top and just stuck it there . Oh well . The bites I had of the House Made Biscuits and Sausage Gravy [two eggs apple wood smoked bacon with breakfast potatoes . $12 . 75] were super flavorful . You can tastes the fat in that sausage gravy . I can see myself gaining 5lbs just eating that . Oh man . As for breakfast potatoes there not much you can say about them . They are crunchy on the outside soft on the inside and needed some ketchup love . Overall I had a decent brunch with great company . Perhaps with all my attention on making faces at the baby my meal was not too note - worthy . I would not mind coming back for brunch though ! ',\n",
       " 'First heard of Vintner Grill during my real estate group cocktail party launch of Diamond Cake magazine . Finally made it around to having dinner here last Saturday . It is tucked away in an office complex off Charleston . The entry is unassuming and easy to miss . The decor is upscale chic modern . We were seated right away as we made reservations from Open Table off Yelp . The clientele that night seemed to be predominantly retiree age with a few scattered specks of youth . Our observation was that most of the women in there looked miserable . (You can marry for money but it does not buy happiness) . You must come dressed up here or feel dramatically out of place amidst the money crowd . Luckily we came prepared . It took a while for someone to finally come over to bring us a menu and take drink orders . The cocktail menu consisted of old timer favorites with modern ingredients . For such a fancy place they could have utilized a classier menu holder rather than a plain clipboard . The selections seemed standard when comparing to previous posts of the menu with some slight changes . One of our favorite things was the butter dish with wells of infused olive oil . . . a welcomed forbidden treat after a week of \"clean eating\" . The bread selection was very nice as well . . . get the brioche and try the cranberry bacon loaf . We each ordered the butter lettuce salad with warm Brie . The salad was a little difficult to eat because of large leaves but the encrusted Brie was good . I ordered the Mediterranean sea bass with haricot vert (French baby green beans) potatoes and chopped olives . The fish was fresh and light just like a sea bass should be the veges were a nice accompaniment and retained their crispness . My wife ordered the veal scallopini with angel hair pasta . I tried some and it was delicious . Lean thin veal cutlets in a wonderful marsala sauce . I would order that the next time . The wine was a Malbec that was smooth and light . They bring the bottle to the table to pour . The waiter seemed a bit too touchy feely for our comfort but not too creepy lol . Service was slow at some points . The prices are Strip prices without the Strip feel . As a local I would rather spend my money on a restaurant on the Strip next time for the same quality of food with a little better service and much better ambiance . ',\n",
       " 'Nothing about this bar excites me . They had a nice B . J lounge over by the MGM grand but the lame Dotty brought out the building . I wish the bar would do somethimg unique to get the blood boiling for a change . Karoke trivia night bingo or something . Shit adding a Touch Tunes machine would help enormously . What happened to the female bartender skimpy outfits? Come on man . EXCITE ME ! ! ! ! ! ',\n",
       " 'Sugar factory is a fun themed restaurant candy store located outside of the Paris hotel on the strip . You are paying to sit right on the strip and also paying for the candy gimmick so come with that in mind and you should have no problem with the prices . My friend and I were able to grab a prime table on the patio and spent about 2 hours here enjoying a long lunch and drinks . My friend and I shared one of the goblets which cost $36 . It was actually a lot to drink and took us a while to finish . We tried one that was a special for the day (week?) called Pineapple Express . It was delicious ! It was mostly strawberry based but also came with a pineapple ring that had been soaked in vodka for 4 days . I think the goblet has dry ice because they bring it out to you and pour the liquid on causing it to bubble up . It was a cute little showy aspect . Might as well make it worth that $36 ! The taste was perfect and not too sweet . We cut up the pineapple and ate it at the end . It was STRONG . I was tasting those 4 days of vodka soaking . My friend said that she heard that you get to keep the goblet but we forgot to take ours so do not quote me on that . For my meal I ordered the French Dip Sandwich ($17) that came with french fries . The portion was really filling . There was a lot of good quality roast beef melty provolone and horseradish served on a garlic baguette that tasted fresh with au jus on the side . I truly enjoyed this sandwich and would definitely order it again . My friend had the Club Sandwich and she enjoyed hers as well . We saw some huge entree salads pass by and those looked like a good option . Breakfast lunch and dinner are offered . Eating here was a fun treat and a good Vegas experience . Plus what are you doing in Vegas if not indulging in oversized alcoholic drinks ! ',\n",
       " 'Went here with my date late night after the Stevie Wonder concert . Unfortunately we were unable to experience the Fireside Lounge but The Peppermill Restaurant was Great ! They had very good food I m a breakfast type guy so I ordered 3 pancakes eggs bacon and sausage ; it was a menu item but I forgot what it was called . My date ordered the 3 cheeseburger sliders and onion rings . Like I said the food was very good and they have large portions so make sure when you come you have a pretty empty stomach we did not even finish our food but they made for great leftovers . ',\n",
       " 'There a part of me that finds humor and appreciation in the terribly bad things in life . I get kicks out of seeing horrible movies (The Room and Troll 2) . I think there a place in the world for avant - garde music and modern art . If nothing more than to shake the seriousness from everyday life . I think a sense of humor is important part of survival in this world . Too many people are too tightly wound these days . Too many people demand perfection from every aspect of life and lose sight as to what is really important : having fun and sometimes just getting by to live another day . It is with that sentiment that I find appreciation in the train wreck that is The Wing Warehouse . This bar is located in a baron strip mall along Northfield Road which by the way is one of the ugliest strips of 2 mile land that I have ever seen outside of some of the most rundown hillbilly areas of Stark County . The location is a foreshadowing of the bar itself . Wing Warehouse is basically a low - rent Section 8 version of a Buffalo Wild Wings . Its recession friendly prices proximity to multiple sleazy motels and the ever diminishing racetrack casino attract a different sort of clientele ; scoundrels day time drunks gabling degenerates and lost souls . For $5 you can get a 24oz domestic along with a gigantic burger and side of fries . That my friends is value . The bar itself is the oddest shape I have ever seen and whoever designed it must have been on acid . Most bars are designed in the shape of a horseshoe semi - circle or even in a straight line . Not the Wing Warehouse . It a multi - leveled multi - sided bar . Think of a concave polygon figure . It as if a 3 year old was the architect who was given a crayon and his scribble was the blueprint to the bar . While the bar is absolutely humongous there no more than 3 seats directly next to each other . It a very odd design . This is not a place to order a mixed drink . If you do you will probably be called a fag . (I m not kidding) . Order a beer . Or a shot of straight liquor . Or both . There are at least 30 drafts to chose from . 28 of them are domestics . 25 of them are Miller or Bud products . 5 Bud Light taps and 5 Miller Light taps . Nothing fancy here . It a place to drink copious amounts of booze and get your buzz on in the least expensive way possible . The jukebox plays the most God awful new age mainstream depressing country music that you could imagine . Every song has the same lyrics about either breaking up with your girl or your favorite pick - em - up truck finally kicking the bucket . Both apparently are hell . After a few drinks I want to blow my brains out . It that f*n depressing . As for the help I actually dig the daytime bartender . She a 30 something year - old divorcée who takes no shit from any of the rude vulgar and chauvinistic pigs that enter that bar . I give her a lot of credit . She takes a lot of shit but she gives it right back . She one tough broad and I like that about her . As terrible as Wing Warehouse is overall I do not mind it . It an absolute train wreck of a place but maybe that what makes it fun and interesting? Or maybe I just feel bad for it? Either way I always enjoy myself here . ',\n",
       " 'This place serves the best BBQ within 5miles of the place I currently spend most of my billing hours . Certainly better than the BBQ Company on 36th . I get the 2 meat combo which comes with a side (beans) chips (good chips) and 2 meats of your choice for like $7 . 50 - $8 . I have tried and been impressed with the Pulled Pork Brisket and Smoked Ham . Their meats have a very nice flvor and are served with just a tiny drizzle of bbq sauce nothing more . The flavor of the meats speak for themselves you really do not need bbq sauce but the drizzle is a nice compliment as opposed to being the main dish as it is at other gross bbq places . Service is quick efficient and very friendly . They have a lot of micro - brew - ish sodas fresh homemade deserts and other yummy treats if that your thing . ',\n",

There is so much going on here . You go in get a drink from the bar and partake in whatever floats your boat . There live music going on in the backyard along with some games like life - sized beer pong corn hole life - sized Jenga etc . Inside you will find a foosball table pool darts shuffleboard connect four and many other games that I may have missed . Boytoy was right when he said this place is like an adult daycare . ',\n",

       " 'Review #500\"For those who believe no proof is necessary . For those who do not no proof is possible\" . Stuart Chase . Personal Musings - What makes a restaurant great? Cutting edge imaginative food? Michelin quality service? Magical ambiance? Dare I say as a foodie they all contribute but Michelin stars James Beard awards even yelp stars mean jack $hit . Great dining experiences are based on the company one chooses to share the meal . Everything else just plays a supporting role . To some it the neighborhood deli down the street or the okazuya of their childhood . To me simply the place that I have celebrated more evenings with friends old and new forged more new relationships in a new city than anywhere else . . . 170 visits . Solid food . Outstanding service (especially at the bar) . Comfortable ambiance . When a rare problem arises it corrected with no fuss or excess intrusion . Nothing get in the way of a great time . New management is currently updating the menu and the wine list . Many old time favorites are gone replaced by simpler dishes and seasonal specials . For starters the seasonal heirloom tomato plate (over a dozen different types of tomatoes dressed in EVOO topped with pink Himalayan sea salt and micro basil) is a must . Colorful and playful for the palate . The contrast in sweetness and acidity between the different types of tomatoes is very pronounced . The exotic mushroom soup is also outstanding . Mushroomy flavor in a broth seemingly including bone marrow in consistency and flavor . Fresh oysters and a classic shrimp cocktail round also make for good eats . This is a steakhouse and the beef shines . The A5 Kobe is the real deal . Ask for the certificate if you do not believe it . Offered in both a filet and boneless rib eye absolutely delicious and the lowest price anywhere on the Strip . Very tender sweet with a clean beef flavor . Very buttery . Order it simply seared (below rare) for the best experience . A good selection of cuts from different producers including an outstanding bison rib eye . All are perfectly seared cooked to temperature simply seasoned with salt and pepper . Other standout mains include the always delicious wild game trio (venison osso bucco elk medallions and wild boar rack chop) and the full size perfectly braised and sauced venison osso bucco . Solid sides including a very fairly priced bone marrow ($6) . Great albeit huge desserts try the souffles . Very good selection of wines by the glass ; massive pours . Well chosen wine list with reasonable Vegas resort pricing . Experiences ready for the making . Bravo . ',\n",

The Chicken and Brie sandwich really was . Even if you are not a huge chicken fan like me but a big brie fan this sandwich paired with a pear and focaccia bread will hit the spot . The sandwich is filling so Asian slaw as the side was perfect . If you are a big big eater you might want the fries . According to others in my party they were great . 2 . A hilarious attentive waiter . He provided great service and made the meal a truly memorable experience . 3 . Trivia night . Who can resist playing?

       " 'I walk through the door of a location that is not unlike the bermuda triangle swallowing up and business that gets its foot in the door . My first thought was deja - vu of course but after I got through that I noticed the decor . The place I would describe as nice sleek hip and decorated with rich dark colors . The bar has beautiful countertops also very dark in color . There also seemed to be somewhat of a steel theme near the bar area mainly the area parallel to where customers dangle their legs . Ninja Sushi can probably seat about 60 - 75 people comfortably . There were 4 tables seated when my family arrived at 5 :30 pm on a Friday (their 1st day open by the way) . The food? Top notch . Some of the best sushi I have eaten . i cannot believe you can buy a California roll for $4 . 95 . We also got a Bubble Bubble roll (even better) for $7 . 95 . Average price for a roll there averages $12 and entrees were about $13 - 14 . Negatives : it took awhile for our food to arrive . You would think a newly - opening restaurant with not a bunch of customers would try and woo their first ones with getting the food out quickly . Of course we had our baby with us and perhaps the chefs were getting used to the menu so perhaps we were a little impatient . No desserts ! What? ! Very odd we were ready to order . The waitress did not know much but I got the feeling they may get desserts but they were not available nor were they on the menu . All things considered mostly food quality and price I give it a thumbs up and will be happy to recommend such a fine Chandler establishment',\n",

       " 'Pretty much the only decent food place in Phoenix ! Many visitors from out of town (aka me) are somewhat disappointed by the \"hot spots\" in town because they are used to a lot better food . Sorry not sorry . Little Miss is pretty much the only redeeming place in town . My friends and I did our due diligence and made it out around 10 :20am about 40 minutes or so before it opened . There were still about 25 people in front of us which ended up being quite a lot of people given that each order is individually sliced at the moment of ordering . Soon after 10 :20 though the tiny lot became full so regardless of the wait coming out around then was a good idea . Plan your moves baby ! Little Miss is not the best bbq I have had but it pretty damn good . I m usually a bigger fan of ribs than brisket but oddly enough the brisket is the clear winner here . The fatty brisket especially was melting in the mouth and was falling apart even as I was holding it . The cole slaw and grits on the other hand were an absolute failure . Like . . . wth? I think maybe they try to focus on the bbq too much that the sides have become truly some sort of \"side . \" But sides are just as important to me and I m glad I had at least the pickles and jalapeno (properly spicy) to lighten up the flavor palate . I do love the hospitality and service . Sunblock and water for the customers? Yas ! All in all solid four stars ! ',\n",
       " 'Review #500Allow me to preface this review by thanking Yelp for providing me the opportunity to become part of such a friendly and positive social community . I am thankful as well as grateful for all the acquaintances and friendships that I have nurtured and developed over the past five years . Since becoming a more active member last year I have attended numerous enjoyable and lively events met many fun and humorous people gained knowledge on the art of photobombing co - hosted three UYEs and established new friendships . Though this review is about a restaurant it significant since my meal at Tender was with two wonderful friends I met thru Yelp . At the same time my main purpose of traveling to Las Vegas was to meet and reunite with old dear friends . And so I dedicate my 500th review to Yelp good friends good food and good times . Now on to the review :a TENDER moment . Truly some of the best food and service I have experienced has been in the gambling capital of America Las Vegas . Many thanks to fellow yelper Rod U . for introducing me to his \"kitchen\" while vacationing in Las Vegas recently . Located on the casino level of the Luxor the bar area is inviting while opening up to the remainder of the spacious restaurant . Though Tender does not look very grand or large from the outside surprisingly the restaurant stretches farther within (as I soon found out after a visit to the restroom) . Since Rod had dined here numerous times (and actually regained his Dukedom during the trip) I allowed him to take the lead on where to sit and what to order . Rod area of choice : the bar of course . Now for those of you who are not fond of bar seating I implore you to rethink your decision . Bar seating is quite enjoyable and entertaining to say the least . It was clearly no surprise that Rod knew practically all of the bartenders working on both of our visits . Mike and Robin stand out particularly in my memory for their outgoing and social personalities . FOOD :*Tomato salad (shared) : A special consisting of various types of tomatoes from the Napa Valley served with mozzarella cheese and spattered with olive oil . It was exquisite . The perfect start to our meal . Recommended if available . *Chilled salmon tasting : Three types were served including house cured gravlax hot apple - wood smoked Skuna Bay salmon and cold smoked Atlantic salmon . Absolutely delicious . I would order this appetizer again for sure . *Lamb Tasting : This dish included lamb rack chop and lamb loin porterhouse . Served with couscous and rosemary garlic lamb sauce . Having only tried lamb once before I decided to be adventurous . The lamb was prepared well and I enjoyed this dish immensely . Cuts and portion size were just right . The second dinner visit with Rod and Terry K proved to be more enjoyable humorous and full of laughter . It seems its always a party with these two whether in Hawaii or on the mainland . Of course we all sat at the bar where we could engage in good conversation with the staff and amongst ourselves . Plus another round of drinks is quicker to order at the bar (*wink) . FOOD :*Escargot (shared) : A nice start to the meal . Small portions shared between the three of us . *Bone Marrow : Generous portion that looks intimidating until you realize the actual portion must be separated from the bones themselves . Very delectable . For those that have yet to try bone marrow take a chance and do try it at least once . *Pork Chop : I was shocked when the dish was finally set before me . The portion is a behemoth certainly . My fear was I would not be able to make a dent after all the appetizers we ordered . The meat was tender and preparation just perfect . DRINK : Martinis and wine were the beverages of choice for dinner . An extensive wine list is available . DESSERT :*Espresso martini : The perfect end to a delicious meal . That is all . SERVICE : Friendly accommodating meticulous with superb attention to detail . And I m not just talking about the bartenders . All staff we encountered exhibited such exceptional customer service . Waters were readily refilled rounds of drinks were quickly provided when requested plates were cleared away and silverware replaced in a timely manner . Appetizers and entrees were also delivered within a reasonable amount of time from when orders were placed . There were some great conversations had with the bartenders especially as they asked about where we were going and what we planned to do while in Vegas . All the while they were also seeing to other patrons and filling drink orders for the restaurant . Just an outstanding showing of camaraderie teamwork and exceptional service overall . A job well done . BOTTOM LINE : A memorable and delicious meal shared with two wonderful friends whom I never would have met were it not for Yelp . Cheers to good friends and good food ! ! ',\n",
       " 'The revitalization of Downtown Las Vegas has included a few casualties along the way . The Western . The former City Hall building (now Zappos corporate office) and more recently The old Gold Spike . The Gold Spike Hotel and Casino was a true dive even by old school Downtown Las Vegas standards . Once the CEO of Zappos started aggressively buying up DTLV real estate he turned his hipster vision into a reality and now a lot of the modern hipsteresque DTLV is the culmination of his vision and of course money . Now understand this is not a direct criticism . I highly respect the man for investing so much in an area of Las Vegas that was truly the definition of dilapidated . Creating Container Park making use of the former City Hall and revamping many tired areas is all worth praise but sometimes things just go to far . Case in point : The Gold Spike . At one time a great low brow casino joint that you could get $1 beers and $ . 50 roulette . Now the Gold Spike does not even offer gambling of any kind . The Gold Spike is now a non - gaming hotel that has turned their once classic dive casino into a hipster wet dream of a bedroom . Beds everywhere pool tables with fur covered handcuffs a patio and courtyard with human Jenga beer pong with trash cans and 3 foot tall chess pieces . And of course a repurposed Jetstream . This Gold Spike would make Jackie Gaughan turn over in his grave . It a hipster hangout of every 19 - 20 year old Vegas kid with his older brother ID . I have been there twice and that is two times more than I needed to go . I miss the old Gold Spike . The revitalization of DTLV is truly a wonderful thing but even it can go to far . And it certainly has at the old Gold Spike . ',\n",

       " 'Featured on BuzzFeed list \"The Best Pizza Spot In Every State According To Yelp\" - - - Casanova Brothers Pizza ! Practically skipping into this clean and great establishment I was greeted by one of the brothers Tony . Charisma and charm exuded from the guy as he introduced himself with a firm handshake . I like this guy ! After our order was placed we took our number to a booth and sat down for a delicious pizza meal . First to come out were some garlic knots on the house from Tony for being first time customers . Fluffy little knots of dough with a kiss of garlic were set before us . Dip it in the supplied marinara and enjoy ! Next out was our order of piping hot fried zucchini . These babies were amazing ! A little while later a beautiful 16\" Deluxe pie was brought to the table . The crust was thin crispy and charred nicely . And it was not greasy ! But did it pass the fold test? It did . The toppings stayed in place and the first bite had a good amount of cheese drag . While our pie held ample toppings the prevailing taste was the sauce . Mmm ! As for eating it cold from the fridge it was just as satisfying . All in all it was a great experience . Tony would come by every now and then to check on things addressing us by our names and gushed with pride about how fresh and great their product is . We even heard him talking about making the Buzzfeed list ! Here hoping they thrive in their new and bigger location once they open ! Much success Casanova Brothers !

       " '15 Word Summary : An order of cheap wonton noodles served so fast you wonder where it came from ! Important Notes : CASH ONLY ! This place is pretty much a completely ad - hoc restaurant . You walk in no menu is served it on a plastic stand on a table with limited choice (Wonton Fish ball or beef noodle soup or non - soup) vegetables with oyster sauce and that pretty much it . Also nothing is actually served except the food so you gotta get up from your lazy ass and serve yourself some tea (meh I guess I can do that but it makes me pretty reluctant in providing any tip ! ) . Now one thing about this place that it known for and that is it INSANE SPEED ! ! You can be in and out of this place in less than 10 minutes flat if you are in a rush ! My friends and co - workers had constantly told me about the ridiculous speeds at which they serve their food here so I decided to actually time it to see if they were bullshitting me or not . KID YOU NOT we ordered 2 wonton noodle soups and a plate of chinese vegetables with oyster sauce . The timing is as follows :30 SECONDS AFTER ORDER : Vegatables Served ! ! ! ! 25 SECONDS AFTER VEGETABLES : Both wonton noodles soups Served ! ! Yes you read that right nearly A MINUTE after walking into the restaurant we were already served our food ! Now this brings up the question of what the hell are they serving us but it actually was pretty decent . The food is a bit bland but the shrimp wontons are pretty big and for $4 . 50 I cannot complain one bit ! ',\n",
       " 'Items Tasted :Sour Cream Cake SamplesAlmond CroissantRaspberry TartPecan RollBlack & White CookieMini Apple StrudelPretzel RollOpened in 1982 and baking fresh bread on East Tropicana for more than ten hours a day from Monday through Saturday since 1988 it was finally on Saturday morning that I made my way to Great Buns Bakery and although often exalted by locals as some of the Valley best bread my experience unfortunately proved average at best the high - scale production and bargain basement prices harkening ingredients and methods no more impressive than that of the average corner store . Owned and operated by \"4th generation bakers\" per the in - store propaganda and prominently displaying its New York - Italian roots in several of its offerings it was to a quarter - full store that I arrived just moments shy of 9 :30 and with elderly servers otherwise occupied I took my time to peruse the largely automated operation whirring in the background as several younger staff members took turns restocking shelves . Treated to samples of crumbly sour - cream cake on the backside of the counter as I wandered past a pair of chillers it was only after ten minutes that I finally crafted my order and although neither the red velvet cupcakes nor cornbread I would desired were yet ready a half - dozen items tallying $7 . 26 were soon boxed and ready to go my first taste of a still - warm pretzel roll enjoyed as I exited the shop originally giving me hope of things to come but eventually proving to be the only standout of the bunch . Clearly not expecting the quality of Bouchon or Bonjour given the obvious discrepancy in price and production it was after a short drive and with coffee in hand that my sampling continued and starting small with an entremet of apple strudel the taste simply fell flat a dry puff pastry with artificial tasting filling that carried right over a slightly superior tart again compromised by a core I m rather certain was Smucker supplied . At this point with expectations decidedly dwindling it was into a soft almond croissant that teeth tore and discarding more than half of the doughy debacle before tasting a fairly forgettable black & white cookie I thankfully found some solace in the sticky pecan bun with ample notes of butter beneath a lacquer of cinnamon - sugar drizzled nuts .

       " 'We came here because we were at the Southpoint anyway and my sister thought it would be a good change of pace from our usual Mexican Italian Steakhouse rotation . I was in agreement because I saw the large menu over the bar proclaiming various offerings like oyster po boys and jamabalya for $7 . 95 . Good deal right?Wrong . This was for weekday lunch only . some of the things are not even available for dinner and if they were the price was about triple . We both ordered the fish and chips . ($23) Her bf got the shrimp and scallop combo . ($21) . Ahem . In what universe are shellfish cheaper? I was assuming it would be a monstrous portion of gigantic fillets at that price point . You know what happens when we assume . There were four small chunks of battered fish atop a pile of fries . They were all crisp and hot and the fish was nice and white but come ON ! I have no idea what kind of fish it was but for that price tag it damned better have been cut from a mermaid tail . And there was no accompaniment like salad or cole slaw either . Only spotting of anything green was pickle specks in the tartar sauce . Could they be charging for the ambience? Well considering the fact that it cafe style seating in an open area of the incredibly loud bustling casino I m guessing not . The waiter was very sweet and seemed almost sheepish . I would be embarrassed to bring the check too buddy and I come from a long line of unscrupulous carpet merchants . It was one of those occasions where you are forced to balance the scales however you can ; up to and including scooping the entire contents of the cracker basket into your purse and leaving it all right on top daring any intrepid employee to say a word . My sister did just that and we strolled out unchallenged . I wo not be strolling back . ',\n",

Do not be fooled by fancy terms like \"prime rib\" or \"sushi\" or even Graham Kerr favorite - Gourmet . If you are looking for a lot of mediocre nearly tasteless food head down to the Bellagio get in line and strap on your feeding bad . At least the Char Siu Pork and Noodle dishes are good . But not worth $40 and a wasted opportunity to eat at another fine Vegas restaurant on a Saturday Night . If you want food that tastes good you would do better at Noodles First or hell go down to main street station . You will spend less and get better food . Trust me . I am sitting at the Buffet right now writing this review and my signal is gone . Conspiracy? Just like the thermite paint theory my friends .

       " 'Me : So what are we doing today?Friend : We are going to a pool . Me : So . . . We can swim?Friend : You can float . No no you can not swim here at the Encore Beach Club . I strongly advise you that if you are going into the pool please keep your head above water at all times . Packed group of people + everyone drinking + the urge to pee = PLEASE . Not only that but heaven forbid you make a splash and melt off some girl makeup . The main point of this beach club is to admire (or be disgusted by) the variety of body types and beach - wear ensembles . As a people - watching enthusiast myself I would give this place top marks . Apparently part of the beach club is of the club Surrender but does it matter when you are busy trying to find a place to sit? We hid our stuff by a tree near an empty table and hopped into the pool . They have shallow edges around and in the middle by the dancing island so a place to sit should not be difficult to find . Drinks are expensive . Perhaps I have been spoiled by pre - gaming but ordering a Bloody Mary for a friend and a shot of Goose for me turned out to be 28 without tip . Phew . On the plus side the DJ really feels the vibe of the audience and plays great music the whole time . And this will be old news but dancing in the water is harder than it looks ! It seriously requires all of your concentration to not look like a walrus flopping in out of dry land . My advice is to pretend to do the slow hula and you will end up looking sexy as hell . ',\n",
       " 'I effing LOOOOOOVE EBC ! Why? ! People are running around half naked and having a damn good time . There nothing to hide here people it all hanging out in the open for everyone to see . Whether it real or fake jiggly or not jiggly you will see it for what it is here . Pool parties in Vegas are awesome . They are a hella (whoa ! i just said hella) good time and I honestly prefer to get chocolate wasted at the pool than at any crowded nightclub in Vegas . Of course when you make a weekend in Vegas the plan is usually to party all day then party all night . I tend to not make it out 100% alive after a day at the pool but this past time I managed to do it . It was my friend bachelorette party and we had about 18 girls with us . We all got in for free and partied in a cabana which had a balcony with a great view of the empty lot that was once Stardust . It did not matter it was nice to have to place in the shade with couches and free alcohol to drink . Some guys our girls knew had a cabana and allowed all 18 of us to hang out and drink their Goose . I drank in the cabana partied in the pool and do not remember much of the walk home . EBC is really nice compared to some of the other pool parties I have been too . It crowded which is a good thing but not the point where it uncomfortable . The pool is clean the area is clean . . . I would not expect anything less from a nice hotel like the Encore . We got there at 12 and it was already jam packed so I suggest getting there earlier than that . Day drinking in Vegas is AWESOME ! Even if you do not make it out at night it okay . Nightclubs are overrated . Pool Parties are where it at ! ;)',\n",
       " 'Mid week brunch lunch . Just like the Asian cheapasses we are we came right before the breakfast changeover into lunch so we paid $19 . 99 for breakfast vs . $21 . 99 for lunch . For the breakfast items it was all the predictable things . The standouts were eggs benedict and pesto grilled tomato . The hollandaise on the benedict actually had tang like it supposed to . The tomato had a thin crunchy panko topping . They started changing out the brekkie stuff way before 11am . It took about 30 mins until it was all changed over with many lunch items still covered in plastic with no serving utensils until many minutes later . So second plate consisted of cold seafood salads . Lots of shrimp and calamari some green lip mussels and none of them were that great . Shrimp were kinda powdery calamari was chewy . Third plate still no lunch food put out yet so I get some cold cuts and smoked salmon . The salmon was in the exact place as the cold seafood salads yet it was there and gone in an instant and never replaced . No cream cheese anywhere not even by the bagels . Fourth plate now they have some lunch stuff out . Got some salmon and non descript white fish (thankfully not tilapia bc that stuff is vile) . Creamy polenta and asparagus warm mussels (the cold ones were better) . And some shrimp pork wonton woup . Fish was tasteless and gross . Polenta was the best I had all meal . Wontons were great but not what I excepted to be the best from the Asian section which was severely lacking . Plate five . Skirt steak OMG nice pink in the center but also a huge sinew in there too . Inedible and also not seasoned enough . Spring roll was gross and oily on the outside . Sushi : only offer CA rolls or veggie rolls . Last plate . Giving up getting dessert . Large strawberries is a plus . Also with watermelon and honeydew but I do not get that gross cantaloupe . The fruit tarts were good with the cream not too sweet but the Napolean was way too sweet and the layers not flaky . Flan was great . Overall the ONLY thing I went back for seconds or thirds was the polenta . I know how much butter and calories is in there though ! Everything else was meh or spit out gross . Bf had brisket turkey and ribs . All practically inedible . Asian section severly lacking . Bottlenecks aka cluster****s at every station . No crab legs at lunch (Aria has them for same price) . I noticed even though they took away plenty of brekkie items way before 11 they kept serving and making pankcake waffles and french toast well into lunch (cheap fillers) . Redeeming quality was our server . Always came back to plates cleared and drinks refilled . ',\n",

I must have gotten the wrong kind or came at the wrong time because my matcha green tea macarons (only ones left at about 4pm) were nasty - they were almost hard as a rock almost could not chew through it . The filling was bitter . My bf said it tasted burnt . For a place called \"Macaron Cafe\" I was expecting to be blown away but I was quite upset . Do not waste your money . This was the first time I have thrown macarons away . One star for the nice staff free sample of slush (which was not good in my opinion) and for being appealing enough to reel me in to buy . But never again . ',\n",
       " 'This place should be avoided at all costs . Luckily I was not subjected to the food but I came here for lunch whilst my two co - workers wanted to try a sandwich . The owner manager was making sandwiches with one rubber gloved hand and the other hand (not gloved) holding his cell phone while he spoke in Italian for the entire 20 minutes we were waiting . He took orders in between chatting on the phone and never once put it down . One co - worker was given her sandwich immediately and we waited patiently for the second . Waiting . . . waiting . . . more waiting . After 10 minutes we enquired about the second sandwich . Oops . He forgot about it . To top off the experience both claim the sandwiches were fairly horrible . Roast beef consisted of : HUGE bun not enough roast beef and way too much mustard . Good thing I did not eat here . ',\n",

All of you Red Lobster bread fanatics need to try the bread here . Also love their dessert especially the Spoon Bar (\"Bailey cocoa bar milk chocolate nougat frozen mousse semi - sweet chocolate pudding\") . I have also tried their bourbon ice cream . Ca not say I absolutely loved it but it was definitely interesting . I think they tend to have interesting ice cream flavors . I have never really been happy with any of their other items I have tried . These items include the foie gras terrine celery soup pork shoulder cassoulet and sorbet . The cassoulet was a disappointment . It sounded great on the menu but it turned out that the egg was the best part of it ; everything else just did not stand out and the beans were especially tasteless . Hard to rate a place when you have mixed feelings . My rating of 3 . 5 out of 5 does not mean it average ; it means I both love and do not really like Spoon (just depends on the item we are talking about) . I usually experience good service here and would not mind coming back . But next time I come it might just be for the bread basket (which I dream about regularly) and Spoon Bar and I will have no shame .

The salads were served fairly quickly by a cook who uniform was clearly encrusted with a week worth of food debris . Gross . . . but where the hell is my sandwich? After 17 minutes of waiting for the sandwich I asked the soccer mom behind the counter to which she replied \"Hon they take a few minutes . \"After another five minutes I got pissed . It is a sandwich . Nobody asked them to make a rack of lamb . Bread meat cheese garnish and a few condiments . Pretty basic stuff right? When I finally complained to the bald guy in the bad Hawaiian shirt who apparently runs the place he simply said \"sorry\" and made the sandwich in front of me . Amber the emo counter girl started to complain to me that they were busy and someone had called off . Bad Hawaiian shirt guy sent her out to smoke .

Decided to come here because we were staying at MGM and did not want to go through the hassle of going to another hotel and rushing back to get ready to go out . I made the reservation day of at around 3 pm for 14 people and told them that we were celebrating my boyfriend birthday and they were able to accommodate . When we got to the restaurant we were led to this little room near the wine rack . It was nice because there was a sliding door that separated us from everybody else so we kind of got a private room . When we sat down and looked at the menu it had \"Happy Birthday Eric ! \" on the top . I was so surprised ! 5 Stars for printing out new menus just for us :) Service was amazing . Always checked up on us and everybody who served us was very professional and friendly . The menu is not too extensive but there was a good variety of food . I ordered the ribeye and the fried calamari . The fried calamari was light and delicious but I have never had bad fried calamari . The ribeye was very good . Cooked perfectly medium rare . Came with potatoes and some veggies . The glaze was a little on the sweet side but not too overbearing . I was also able to try the chicken breast and let me tell you it was the juiciest chicken I have ever had . Probably would get this the next time we come here . The food did take a little while to come out but I think it was cause they wanted to serve us all at the same time . All in all food was good service was amazing and boy did they make us feel special . Last but not least we had a party of 14 and they did not even charge the 18% gratuity ! ! Our waiter told us that he was leaving it up to us but of course we gave the 18% for the wonderful service we received . TAKEAWAYS : + service ! ! ! ',\n",

Walking in you can immediately see a wall with a beautiful display especially a tall 7 tiered wedding cake display . As my friend said . . . I just want to bring that home and look at it ! \" . The colours there are all pastel greens and pinks . It set up to be an open seating where we pay at the front and sit wherever there space open .

They honored my YELP check - in offer (wow what a concept - unlike Nittayas Secret Kitchen) and the Hawaiian Martini was fabulous ! I even ordered it as we were paying our bill and our waiter brought it right away . He was great ! Very nice genuine and offered friendly service . He made some excellent recommendations and was gracious when I told him I did not like one of the rolls he brought out . He took it off our bill . This was my first time at Roy in Las Vegas and they brought out some complimentary items for us to try (some edename and pork ribs - yummy) . I frequented Roy in Scottsdale quite often so I did not even open a menu . The butterfish is always a favorite . I actually had butterfish for the first time in South Africa and it was prepared like its namesake . When I saw it on Roy menu and ordered it I knew it would be a marriage made in heaven and I have been ordering it every time I visit . Tuna roll was very good but I skipped on dessert which is always the Lava cake because after shopping at Zara I decided to pass on the extra calories ! ',\n",

I have seen this place on Groupon but had trouble locating them from the street as they are behind the Landry and signage simply says \"coffee shop\" rather than the store name . Was welcomed by multiple staff when I entered menu is small and consists of hot and cold coffees a few sandwiches and Thrifty ice cream - a brand multiple small cafes have started selling which I totally do not understand . Iced vanilla latte was simple enough and not overly sweet . Price was on par with anywhere else .

The hell you saying?\" I say looking like a confused dog with my head tilted to one side . \"Poke made with fish you know poke poke poke\" being totally serious as he jabs his finger into my side . Yes were talking ahi limu poke wasabi shoyu poke etc . Is it as good as back home? No . But it is prepared in a way that makes it more approachable to mainland taste . Cultural sharing through food is a good thing . The various selections of ahi poke are made from previously frozen fish . The sauces are deeply flavored but since the fish is not fresh when marinated the flavor does not permeate it just coats the outside . Limu (fresh raw seaweed) is used very sparingly and lacks the texture and ocean flavor you would expect . Several types of poke such as the raw salmon (with onion green onion soy sesame oil and sesame seeds) and ahi kim chee poke (exactly as it name implies) are not traditional but taste surprisingly good . Prices are high compared to Hawaii (about $12 . 50 per pound for frozen fish) but expected . It a poke shop in the desert after all . Recommended for those wanting a taste of Hawaii or the Hawaii expat jonesing for a fix of home . As for my bud I never corrected his mispronunciation . Payback for poking me in the side and bluffing me out of a huge pot . ',\n",
       " 'My experience of eating from Luncha Libre was memorable yet foggy . . . I was at a beer festival at Heritage Square last December . After a few hours of countless free beer tastings I was walking sideways and chatting up way too many strangers . My husband went on a mission to find something other than beer to fill my belly . He comes back with a paper tray and said \"Here . Vegetarian quesadillas . \" I took a bite . Angels singing . . . then the heat creeped up . I started devouring it . My friends came over and started tearing pieces off like the rude ravenous hyenas they are . I turned and ran for cover behind an abandoned beer tent and finished off my quesadillas in a dark corner . Really it was reminiscent of that \"Nature \" show on PBS . I polished them off and then proceeded to lick my fingers . By the time my husband found me I was in a happy belly trance . So yes I will seek Luncha Libra for some more of their delicious food .

What a welcome addition to the downtown lunch (and breakfast) scene . The sign out front boast that they have got the \"Best Chicken in the Burg ! ! \" Now I do not want to ruffle any feathers here but let get real ; ever since George Aiken closed up shop there has not been any chicken in the Burgh . That sign should read \"The Only Chicken in the Burgh\" ; and it some really good chicken too ! I stopped in for lunch today and got a four piece meal which is supposed to include half a chicken potato wedges and slaw . I m not complaining but I got two breast instead of a breast and a thigh . The chicken was deep fried super moist with a tasty slightly peppery coating . The breast were huge but the drumstick and wing was average in size . Still though it was more food than I could eat . On the menu you get a choice of a two piece meal or a four piece meal . I thought a two piece would be too small so I went with the four piece meal . I wish they had a three piece meal ; but it nice that you can go a la carte and get exactly what you want . In addition to fried chicken meals they also have chicken tenders chicken sandwiches fish sandwiches and a breakfast sandwich . The facility itself is geared more towards take out than dining in . There is a counter along the window with count them seven stools where you could enjoy your lunch . There also two tables with five chairs available for those that insist on dining in . So hey do not stay cooped up in your office for lunch . If you can wing it go ahead and get yourself some lunch or breakfast at the Pittsburgh Poultry Company . Then maybe you too will have something to crow about . ',\n",

Parking our car & leaving the event was a breeze because it was definitely organized . Loved the food choices ! We were able to try Pineapple Park Stripburger Hash House Sauced Amore & much more . Our favorite would have to be the single slice Amore pizza that came with water since water was sold separately with other dishes & the fact that we did not have to buy a whole Amore pizza for $20 + . We also loved the Kiwi Watermelonade (?) from Hash House ; so refreshing on a sunny day ! The weather was definitely perfect on this day ! It did get a bit cooler at night & I was not prepared at all . Haha . For $17 I was able to see American Authors & a little of Colbie Caillat ! Music was great but we were definitely more fatties & ate continuously throughout . We were unable to stay any longer cause it got too cold for me but I will be prepared next year . Honestly you do not need VIP treatment (overrated ! ) . We enjoyed walking around eating vendor foods standing for the concerts relaxing on the grass (many spots with shade) and people watching . I would not want to be stuck under a tent for what $100 or something like that? Pfffft ! As my Hawaiian boyfriend always says \"No need brah ! No need ! \" Get in for cheap & enjoy the event . Ca not wait for next year ! :)',\n",
       " 'There was a time when you insisted on getting your Pierogies from the churches . They were authentic recipes made with love by church ladies . Pierogies Plus hires church ladies and it a lot easier than buying from churches . Seriously they ship Pierogies all over the world and their product is the gold standard . Plan some extra time because this is not fast food . The counter always seems slow to me they do things their own way but now I find it rather charming . They have some coupons on their website and there have been Groupon deals in the past so check for those . Bottom line the Pierogies are amazing and authentic . ',\n",
       " 'Came here for dinner recently and what you will find here is your basic Hawaiian dishes . Kauai Cafe is located off Tropicana and Hualapai (the Westside) . Upon reviewing the menu the one thing I noticed is their prices . Price here is not too bad . Dinner for two will set you back only about $20 which is not bad in my opinion . The selection is decent and it pretty much what you will find at other Hawaiian location . However the one issue with Hawaiian food out here is that there a ton of them and I have my favorites already . So let get to the review . As for their food I got their Loco Moco since it one of my favorite dishes . Plus I wanted something with a huge protein count . In case you are not in the know a Loco Moco consist of rice hamburger eggs and gravy . KC mixes their gravy with mushrooms which was a good touch to be different . Seems boring but I have one word for this order . . . delicious . This order filled me up but I was not done . I always get a Spam Masubi or Katsu Masubi at least once when I hit up a new Hawaiian joint . KC did not have a Katsu Masubi so a regular spam it is . I was little disappointed with KC spam masubi only because it was small not as tightly wrapped and the spam was a bit undercooked . The restaurant is small cozy and the staff is extremely nice . The owner dad even stopped at our table to chit chat for a little bit . Okay a lot of bit . But he cool and just added to our dining experience . I want to say that Kauai Cafe is just okay but I really have not tried anything else . I still have their Kalbi to try (even though I stole a bite from TR) their Katsu their Heineken battered chicken and Ahi Ahi (cannot remember if they have that one) . From the minimal amount of reviews so far it their Kahlua Pork that they are known for . It going to be tough for me to judge that one since I do not eat much pork . I will still make my way back to try the other dishes I missed . Who knows? Maybe my rating drops to 3 or goes up to a 5 based on my next couple of visits . But as of right now I m just a fan . Loco Moco : http : www . yelp . com user_local_photos?select = 2yrhVS5ouE7MxvNx8gUIvQ&userid = y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQA must have if you are eating here : http : www . yelp . com user_local_photos?select = Xiijz8zyiTaG76CdzGhOAg&userid = y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ',\n",
       " 'I cannot stand this place . Yet another yogurt company capitalizing on the FroYo craze of 2008 and this one is terribly executed . Most of the places operate in a normal order - person fills order - pay - eat format . Not MoJo . They for whatever reason want to be different . This means it is self - service almost the whole way through . You wait in line for a machine that puts out the flavor of yogurt you want . Then when you get there it is usually blinking and telling you that you have to wait for it to freeze up . Once you get a decent amount of yogurt it usually tells you that you have to wait again because it has to refreeze . 10 minutes later you have filled a cup comparably to what you usually get at a Full Service Yogurt place . You then are given the ability to top it off with a tray of condiments similar to the breakfast bar at Holiday Inn . Of course you have no idea where those spoons have been and can almost guarantee that some 5 year old licked his yogurt then stuck the spoon in it as he was pouring too many M&Ms on his frozen treat . So you top off your yogurt in a manner similar to what you would find elsewhere and move to the next station . You have no reached the end where you finally interact with a human . This person then weighs your creation (mind you it is the exact same as one you would get at a full service yogurt place) and then he tells you that it will be $15 . I m sorry what? $15 for yogurt . This size is $5 at every other yogurt place and you want three times that? When I did all of the work? Oh no . These places are such a ripoff . It costs them $0 . 08 per ounce of this stuff . Unless you are covering it with caviar macadamia nuts and gold leaves - it is not worth what they charge . ',\n",

I love the presentation & how all of it combines so well . . the herbed remoulade marinated cherry tomatoes avocados were better than any Louis I have ever had . Kudos to the chef ! Grilled Ribeye was cooked to perfection w a wonderful red wine au jus fresh time & the caramelized shallots offered a nice flavoring even tho I did not eat them . The mash potatoes under the Ribeye almost tasted like a polenta so flavorful ! The Grilled Octopus was a chef special & as long as I have supported Wolfgang Puck restaurants he changes his menu up seasonally like a Spagos for instance I fall in love w something & next time it gone . These creations are absolutely mouthwatering . The Grilled octopus & potato melt in your mouth . Thankfully the chef could make the Shrimp Fettuccine that I am so in love w ! ! The buttery Fettuccine Scampi Style Shrimp & that garlic is where it at ! Not a fan of the Italian Sausage Pizza . It was overwhelmed by caramelized red onions . The créme fraiche mozzarella garlic & Fresno peppers gave it a nice touch so next time no onions for me . Thank you Chef Puck & chef we do not see that truly deserve the credit . Wish all things could remain the same & I am looking forward to the new one at Caesar Forum Shops . ',\n",

But my job now requires me to work nights and there are few places to eat in Gastonia after midnight . Which is how I found myself at Applebee . So any restaurant in Gastonia gets extra weird on the weekend when the yokels come to town for a night out . Believe me you will see some characters . Let me preface this is not a review for Applebee . This is a review for Friday night at Applebee . The food is just as shitty . But the entertainment is top notch .

       " 'If you do not easily get offended by profanity or mockery towards you then I think you will enjoy this restaurant . It is located inside the Excalibur Hotel Casino in the Las Vegas Strip . Supposedly but not sure this place is suppose to resemble an east coast attitude type of restaurant . The satire is to act like rude waiters and waitresses without giving a sh*t about how the patrons feel about the service . When you first walk in the hostess asks you if you have ever been here or know what this place is all about . You could say yes or no while you are being seated . But ultimately you will see a sign that tells you as you kind of and cannot help but check the restaurant decoratives around the walls . Or you will hear profanity being shouted by the servers . . . of course in the name of fun . Believe it or not the food and drinks here are quite good . We ordered a bacon burger a local moco and a rib eye steak along with a hurricane and a strawberry daiquiri slush an iced tea and a brownie in a cup topped with whipped cream and jarred cherries . The bacon burger was huge . It prepared with generous proportions of a beef patty and bacon strips with lettuce and tomatoes served with french fries . It was good . The local moco was also delicious . The beef patty was also a good size topped with an egg with gravy and some hot sauce with white rice underneath . It was tasty and I devoured it and wanted to order a second . The rib eye steak was probably the biggest surprise of our meal . I really did not expect anything special . I actually tried to persuade my friend to order something else . Oh boy I was wrong ! The rib eye was cooked medium and the steak was quite big at 14 ounces . It was served with steamed vegetables but the meat was delicious with flavor . The iced tea is just iced tea but their spiked slushies are awesome . It sweet and is fruity . . . very refreshing but with liquor mixed in it . However the liquor seems more camaflouged in the strawberry daiquiri though . . . haha . Fyi all the food and drinks ordered is for three people . In case you thought I was a big eater which i am . Haha . Dick is a very fun place to hang out . Good food and drinks makes a difference . The ambiance is very east coast like indeed along with its attitude . But you must be able to not get offended easily from what is said and be cool . Our waitress was actually really nice even with her wise cracks . Enjoy your time there and cheers ! ',\n",
       " 'I am always on the hunt for a good Italian bakery . Cannoli rainbow cookies black and white cookies breads rugelach sfogliatella (lobster tail pastries) breads . Unfortunately I love all of these things . All of the above and more can be found at New York West Pastry & Bake Shop . They also have kringles which are a Danish pastry loaf cakes coffee cakes cupcakes cheesecake and lots of cookies . It was sensory overload when we walked in here . Because there were several people in here and the girl who greeted us seemed eager to get our order going we starting picking stuff quickly . I had to show restraint here as there were so many lovely things in the cases and on the tables here . There were many seasonal Halloween cookies available also . We ended up with a box with cannoli sfogliatella rainbow cookies black and white cookies a Halloween sprinkle cookie and a Devil Dawg . Everything was very tasty of our picks but I would have to say my absolute faves were the rainbow cookies black and white cookies and Devil Dawg . Everything was so very fresh . The Devil Dawg was decadently rich layers of cake chocolate ganache and frosting . I had a bite of this fairly large concoction and I am sure it was like about 2 000 calories ;) OMG so good . The girl who helped us seemed to want to get people through the line quickly which I can appreciate but a little more warmth would have been welcome . There is a dining area here in the bake shop if you want to sit and eat your purchases here . New York West Pastry & Bake Shop is a off the beaten path a bit but is a hidden gem worth seeking out in Sun City . ',\n",
       " 'I have not been inside the actual restaurant so I cannot comment on that but I have tried their sandwiches twice (once at a party and once from my boyfriend bringing one home) . I had the roast beef with horseradish mayonnaise both times and it absolutely delicious . I think one of the coolest things about this place is that they have tons of different sandwiches and you can pick from a variety of different types of mayo or dressing for your sandwich . The roast beef is I believe on sourdough bread and as the other reviewer said the meat comes piled high . Bread is delicious horseradish mayo is delicious and the meat is super tasty . I m craving one right now - - wish it was closer to my work ! I look forward to actually going into the restaurant and trying the lemonade that the other reviewer mentioned . Will update my review once I do ! ',\n",
       " '(1 . 50 stars) When I m about to board a 5 hour flight I stuff a sandwich and soda bottle into my messenger bag for later consumption . The expectation is about as basic as I m ever going to have regarding food . Paradise Bakery which apparently is a very well - regarded local chain really needs to assess how to translate their successes into an airport setting . Although she appeared to be very bored the young lady at the counter was friendly - - no attitude problem . I wanted mayo instead of their \"Paradise Sauce \" and she delivered here as well . The sandwich was reasonably thick with meat greens and tomatoes . Bread which was understood to be their strong suit was over - sized and a bit stale ; perhaps I waited too long to eat it . There were no bottles of unsugared soda but water was fine . Where did things go wrong? First there was not enough paper used to wrap the sandwich and keep it intact ; how expensive would 3\" of additional paper on a $7 . 50 sandwich have been? Next no napkins were packed ; this should be an automatic at airport carryout . Third for some reason a chocolate chip cookie was thrown into the bag . For reasons which will be clear in a moment it was very broken (but very tasty) when I found it . Finally although I specifically asked for a cheap plastic bag I was given a froufrou paper mini shopping bag with an \"adorable\" paper handle . I do not need to impress my fellow passengers with my good taste in shopping bags I needed something which will neatly compress to be stowed . If you have ever tried to reassemble a sandwich while in the middle seat of an airplane you get the picture . The end - product was adequate with mayo and tomato covered hands as an added bonus . Once again life teaches me that lowering your standards just a little ultimately means that reasonable expectations become unrealistic . ',\n",

I do not know why I have never experienced Korean food and I m not saying one visit to this fast food Korean joint qualifies me as any kind of authority on it but I do know what tastes good and what I like . I liked the Bulgogi at Juns . Despite a gentle snub from an actual Korean about Jun being \"fast food\" we decided to give it a try anyways . I attribute that to Mel C review (thanks Mel ! )The Bulgogi plate was generous with rice a fresh salad with a light asian love - you - long - time type of dressing and thinly sliced tender flavorful marinated beef stir fried with onions . I ate all the meat and enjoyed it . My only wish was that it could have had more of a carmelized sear to it . That would have made it perfect . The other dish ordered was the Bi Bim Bop . . . fun to say but another dish that was new to us . Rice topped with veges like shredded napa cabbage tossed in sesame oil stir fried meat with mushrooms and topped with a sunny side egg the yolk begging to be broken . We enjoyed that as well . I know this may seem like going to Panda Express for Chinese food but when it good it good . My new quest will now be to find the best Bulgogi . Thank you Jun for opening my Asian eyes (lol) to Korean food and thank you for the wonderful service .

       " 'WHAT TO TRY? ! Omakase ! ! Whether it be the regular omakase or the premium upgrade of the omakase they are both delicious ! Regular omakase costs $105 pp and the upgrade is an additional $25 pp . The only difference between the regular and the upgrade is the amount of sashimi you get with the upgrade as the first course . Regular would only get you an oyster and scallops whereas a premium omakase will get you an additional sashimi pieces . You get uni from Japan blue fin tuna slices lobster sashimi and stripe jack fish slice . You have to really love fish because the whole omakase is fish from different areas of the world ! The experience really takes you around the world with the fish they source from and present before you . Their kitchen is basically what you see when you enter the restaurant ! They make everything at the bar . It really cool to see them make your sushi right before your eyes . Unlike other omakase it not about the presentation here . Nothing fancy accompanies the sushi or sashimi slices and you wo not see any flowers or fog or great presentation . It just the freshness of the fish and where they source their fish that makes up the price that you pay . My favorite dish is of course the blue fin tuna . There were three pieces of different sections of the blue fin tuna that was served as three pieces of sushi as one course . I loved every piece of it that I ordered more of it ! If you want more sushi you can order at the end of the meal too . Just to let you know the benchmark you are looking at is $7 - 9 per sushi if you want more sushi and depending on what sushi you order more of ! There is also a wine menu that you can order alcohol to accompany your omakase experience . Ranges from 4 oz of sake to 9 oz of Japanese wine to a full bottle of 300 - 700 ml . There was one bottle of Japanese wine that was about $1000 ! You can also do sake pairing ($65) with the set course which is nice ! Overall I thought the chefs were nice to show their knife craftsmanship before our eyes and our particular chef greeted us with a smile . I liked how they kept asking us how our experience was and made us feel very welcomed . And most of all the dishes came from all over the world . From Boston to Vancouver to Mexico to Iceland to Alaska to New Zealand I felt like I went fishing around the world and got to taste of the world ! LAST TIP? ! The restaurant is REALLY small . I really recommend you to make a reservation to sit at the bar because you get to see the knife action before your eyes . Like I said the kitchen is basically where the three chefs stand at the bar . There are only two tables that surround the outer area of the bar that people can sit at . Either two or four people . You can somewhat see the chef but you wo not have a good view of the fish they are slicing or what they are doing behind the bar ! So yes worth the wait to find a spot at the bar ! ! Premium upgrade is worth it if you love sashimi and want to try out more sashimi from various parts of the world . It is also additional food so if you are up for more premium is a good option to go . I think I would still order premium set next time I go ! Mind you some of the sushi you order may appear throughout the courses you see with the regular omakase too (except for the lobster sashimi and the uni sashimi that is from Hokkaido) . There no particular spot where I would sit at the bar that would be better . I guess it depends on which chef you like best if you go here often but it usually preassigned because there only 12 seats around the bar for each sitting ! ! ',\n",

I did actually . The real question is why do not I go every month ! ?So now I m hopped up on a dirty chai latte and I must share the details about this neighborhood gem . Truly the Valley BEST neighborhood coffee shop ! For a number of reasons . . . 1 . ) Grinders is a place where everyone feels welcome from high school kids to retirees taking advantage of the free wi - fi . 2 . ) They roast their OWN beans . That right . They wheel a roaster out onto the same concrete slab that becomes the stage for Valley blues legends like Ronnie Whitehead on 2nd Saturdays and roast the beans for themselves ! ! I find their coffees to be pretty earthy and smooth . 3 . ) The fudgy pecan brownies are rich and chocolaty . The scones are biscuit - like and just the right amount of barely sweet . (I have not tried the danish but they look deadly ! )4 . ) They are generous in sharing their own talents and promoting the talents of others ensuring access to arts and culture . Each month they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls . And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p . m . on Saturday an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to live jazz and or blues from 8 - 10 p . m .

They serve breakfast lunch and dinner . We came in for dinner on Sunday night and the restaurant was mostly empty so we received prompt service . My friend dish was the Penne Greek Style to which she added shrimp and had no complaints about . I ordered a fettuccine with meat sauce and asparagus . The meat sauce was really hearty and delicious while the small bites of asparagus added a nice fresh crunch . The pieces could have been slightly larger though . I added a meatball which was not good at all . The inside was just warm and there were weird hard bits in it . As long as you stay away from the meatballs this is a good pre - party dinner for people who are staying at the Palazzo or Venetian . ',\n",

It also comes with some spicy Chili Peppers Pickled Red Onions Lime Tortillas and homemade Salsa . The Mexican sodas that they have are always a fun treat as well . Service is very friendly and the ordering process is not very difficult . You can get a 1 4 1 2 of whole chicken and they will cut it up and have it ready to go . Hoping they may eventually add some more proteins to the menu . How about a little marinated Beef Pork or some spicy Shrimp .

Not sure what to expect being my first time @ this place (may I add how I was excited & actually having a celebration lunch) & immediately they were wheeling around appetizers asking tables what they would like . So confused on how things work here mainly because nobody told me . Several times I asked for entrees and each time they told me they had no more . Never once was I presented a menu so I literally had a appetizer lunch with no menu at all I have never felt so bamboozled & unsatisfied in Chinese food history . LET ME TELL YOU a bad review from me is very rare as a matter a fact? This is my first ! I hate this place now & I will never recommend this terrible customer service to anybody . Also the manager at the time still wanted me to pay the full price for all the crappy little appetizers that were basically forced upon me . I tried to explain my dissatisfaction & how un pleased I was with never receiving a menu & she told me the customer is suppose to ask for one ! ! Where do they do that at ! ? So I m automatically suppose to know how procedure goes at this restaurant being my first time there ! ? Bull crap ! ! ! Never again ! !

I found Defalco the first week during my initial scouting trip to Arizona a few years ago . After my first taste of their Chicken Parmigiana sandwich I was hooked . I love the meatball sandwich as well . But my favorite is definitely the Italian Sausage served with roasted green peppers and onions with the marinara sauce on the roll of your choice . Talk about foodie nirvana ; The Italian Sausage sandwich does it for me . I keep coming here because the food is excellent and the pricing is reasonable . One time my family members ordered half sandwiches of the same item and they gave us the full sandwich pricing which was a discount from half sandwich pricing . They did not have to do that . But that just one of the ways that they look out for their customers . This place gets really busy and it can be a challenge to find seating during the busy lunch and dinner hours .

Unfortunately I had never been here and had a couple of out of town guests who googled Italian food on their phone and this one popped up and was close to their hotel . I tried to steer them away from this place as restaurants on or near the strip are usually incredibly overpriced and the food is usually at best mediocre . Well my attempt at steering them to a known commodity did not work . Battista it was . I m not going to get into details on this place as they have been discussed ad nauseum on Yelp . The food in this place is not only unpalatable but is probably dangerous . Chemical tasting food that I can picture being cooked up in large tubs in the back is what this place serves . The wine they serve is not quite up to the same quality someone on food stamps would buy to use as cooking wine . Do not get me wrong I do not mind cheap wine but this stuff was not fit to be consumed by humans . To top it all off they serve a Nescafe Corn Syrupy type chocolate drink at the end . This place has a cozy ambiance according to other review but that where the positives end . This place preys on unsuspecting tourists who do not know any better until it too late . I cannot imagine anyone ever going back to this place . This place treats its customers like cattle well maybe worse actually . They could care less about your experience and possible return business since they are located in a spot that see a few million new visitors each year . This restaurant would not last 3 months in another city that must rely on return customers and positive word of mouth . Please people do not go to this awful place with these awful people .

And in reality it is a lot . So much that you can hear the strained whines and cries of other patrons trying to finish their garlic bread . Or was it Texas Toast? I do not think it counts as Texas Toast if it only grilled on one side . Why do I keep capitalizing Texas Toast? And why is everyone staring at me?

There was a large party eating while we were there but I did see several people come in to place orders to go . I picked a seat next to the wall that has writing on it . The wall has various menu items written on it and other sides . I thought it was real cool that they had \"yelp\" written at the top on the wall . We waited as out food was cooked fresh . I had planned on ordering the \"Euro Fries\" however last minute I saw a flyer near the cashier that said they had these new \"Carne Asada Fries\" and I quickly decided to try that ! . To be honest the meat was chewy and had no flavor . I would not care for that again but everything else on the fries I would eat over and over . It had fresh made chipotle mayo and avocado mayo that complimented the fries well ! My man had the \"Smoked Dog\" . That was a spicy link (he said it was not spicy at all but tasty) with caramelized onions slaw (he had that left off) cheddar and garlic mayo . He enjoyed it a lot !

       " 'We had an early dinner reservation here a few weeks ago . The hostess went to seat us and the available seating inside was sporadic and somewhat uncomfortable IE sitting in the smallest communal booth between two big parties . I asked if we could go outside where we quickly found a table and began looking over the menus . I have been here a couple of times with some mixed feelings about the service but really loved the food . For this trip I started with the Pennsylvanian which was bourbon st germaine lavender & bitters . Albeit a little pricey but to be expected it was darn good . It packed a nice punch and the lavender lent small traces of floral through the cocktail . Pleasant and refreshing on this summer day . Since my last visit they have altered their menu and my once beloved duck dish was omitted . I decided to do a mixed grill with two selections grilled salmon striped bass with vegetable stir - fry and it came with dipping sauces . Entrees came out in a reasonable time and I dug in . First I would note that unless you are not hungry getting only one selection will leave you needing more . The pieces were not large but with the two selections together were enough to satisfy my hunger and both were cooked well and seasoned nicely . Now to the major disappointment on my plate my vegetable stir fry . After eating them I felt like I had downed a bottle of soy sauce . They were drenched in sauce and so so salty . I managed to eat most of them mainly because I was hungry and did not want to waste this pricey meal but really they were not good . To top it off they were not cooked right either . I like some bite to my cooked veggies but some of the pieces were raw . The celery literally crunch in my mouth like a raw stock . If it was not for how undercooked the veggies were I would have guessed that these came out of a frozen microwaved bag with a premade sauce already on them . Hard to believe a chef would have prepared that for an upscale restaurant . Lesson learned and please bring back the duck !

       " 'I was hesitant of going here after seeing their 3 . 5 star rating on Yelp but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food here . House - made healthy soup salad sandwiches served at an affordable price . Though I did like the food I thought the service here was just odd . They have an assembly line where each staff seems to have a set station but it extremely unorganized and inefficient . I also think the ordering system here is plain confusing . I do not know if it just me but I had a hard time figuring out how to order or what to get . Also did not help because I m at one station ordering a sandwich and a staff at a soup station is already asking me what soup I m ordering . \"Would you like some soup today?\" . . . \"Sorry I m still deciding . \" Then 20 seconds later \"Would you like some soup today?\" \"WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SOUP TODAY?\" . . . . Holy moly how many times are you going to ask me? Calm down soup server . I m not ready yet . I guess it is my fault for not knowing what I want on my first visit? Then come to the register and we are met with a rude cashier . Ugh . On the bright side our food was fantastic . We got kale and quinoa salad cuban grilled pork panini sandwich wild mushroom bisque and asian citrus chicken salad . Salads were drenched in dressing so I did not like it too much . However I did enjoy the sandwich and mushroom soup . Cuban grilled pork had a smoky taste to it . Panini was thin and sandwich was a small portion but I loved the flavor . Small bite and I was instantly in love . One bite kept me wanting another . Mushroom soup was rich and creamy wish it had more mushroom in it instead of few small pieces . I got to try a sample of tomato basil soup and that was one of the best soup I had . Wish they sell it by gallon . Unpleasant service but enjoyed the food . I would come back in a heartbeat especially now that I know what I like from here . ',\n",
       " 'I have been waiting and waiting and now finally Christmas has come early this year . Potbelly has finally opened in Chandler ! \"Yippee Ki Yay\" (you know the rest) . LOLNearly five years ago I wrote a Yelp Review about their new Scottsdale location \"that Potbelly makes a tasty little sandwich for $4 . 80 and an even better one for $5 . 00 . (Now $5 . 85)\"Potbelly is a yummy Midwest sandwich place that is known primarily for their Wreck sub . It made with salami roast beef turkey and ham along with swiss cheese . \"They also have two similar subs called : \"Italian\" with Capicola Mortadella Pepperoni Salami with Provolone cheese and a \"Pizza Sandwich\" which has many of the same cuts of deli meat but comes with marinara sauce . \"Okay my Midwest bias aside Potbelly is familiar in many ways to other sandwich sub places yet very different . In the beginning they had local musicians playing in their shoppes . I believe that feature is gone now . But their pressed tin ceilings potbelly stove (Really? In Arizona?) and all of the eccentric posters and pictures make it a fun tripI started a small argument in my office today when I mentioned this location was open . Seemed everyone had their own idea on what make Potbelly special . The consensus was the Wreck and their Shakes . Go figure . So my Sitrep is that Potbelly combines a very well made tasty Parisian bread that is lightly toasted with premium cold cuts . Then throw in some spicy Giardiniera (Chicago style hot peppers) some condiments rabbit food etc and Bingo - you have a Potbelly sub . Btw Potbelly comes in two sizes Regular - about 6 1 2\" and Bigs which I taped measured at 10\" . See photo . Enjoy ! ',\n",
       " 'Once when I was in Highschool we used to come here at lunch and there was this ballin old dude named Phil who was the bomb . Phil would sneak us extra fries and pickles and stuff . He was like a kindly old Grandpa who somehow still worked in the fast food industry but was not jaded by it . It was magnificent . In fact one time we arrived and he was driving his car in to the parking lot . He was so excited to see us that he waved did not pay attention and mashed into the dumpster . Bummer Phil . But what a gem . Phil is gone now . Last time I went here I wound up waiting over 10 minutes in their drivethru line for a poorly assembled burger that had definitely been sitting on the warming rack for the past millenia . Not good but I was starving . At least it was only $3 . Bring back Phil . He should be the only old thing behind your counter . ',\n",

       " 'I never expect a whole lot out of chain restaurants that dress themselves up and pretend they are fine dining . It not that I m a snob and insist on REAL fine dining . It that I would just rather go to a local joint that is family owned where the dishes were not conceived at some bullshit food academy alongside a picturesque hillside in Tuscany . All that being said occasionally my wife convinces me that it a good idea to go to one of those places and in the case of Brio their carbonara is pretty freaking tasty . I do not care if it even remotely traditional or authentic . It tastes great . Our service was comical . My wife and I ordered a bottle of wine and our server had no clue how to open it . She would never seen a wine bottle before in her life - not even a picture of one in a magazine . I m surprised she did not just set it down on the table and walk away . How could she know so little about how to open it but at the same time know that it needed to be opened? I do not fault her at all . Restaurants should not hire people to serve food and wine unless they have proven in some way or another that they are capable of doing these things at the most basic level . I felt so much pain in my heart for her that I eventually asked her to lean strategically into the table to hide me from her manager while I opened the bottle for her . I wish I had video of her attempts before I took mercy on her though . It was positively fantastic stuff . She was bad all around but she was attractive and had a bubbly personality something my wife and I both appreciate in a server of either gender . The food though . . . In the world of chain Italian make - believe fine dining establishments Brio reigns supreme . I could have eaten the carbonara until I exploded like the guy in Seven . ',\n",

However food quality needs little bit of improvement . I ordered the bulgogi dolsot bibimbap . When this order came out I thought we had received it by mistake . It should not be called bibimbap because I was expecting lots of vegetables and this dish had bare minimum . For those who are hard core meat eaters I can see you will like this dish . It mostly meat and rice . It was also greasy from all the meat . The rice portion was small in comparison to the meat as well . I could have done with half the meat . It was also on the sweet side . Next time I will try their regular bibimbap . Hubby ordered the seafood soon tofu . They did not ask for spice level so it comes out on the milder side . The flavor was very bland the broth lacked any depth . Recommend going across the street for this dish . Overall I know they just opened couple of weeks ago so I will try couple more times and update my review . ',\n",

       " 'Come here for greasy no frills no banter diner breakfast . If you were not reading this review you might never notice this place - it on a side street in Leslieville and is barely perceivable on a neighbourhood stroll . NOTES :* As soon as you walk in and sit down the owner starts making your breakfast . There is a menu but no point in looking at it . Unless you state otherwise you are getting two eggs (over easy) bacon home fries and toast . So if you want to deviate from this best get your words in within the 120 second timeframe between entering and sitting down on a barstool . * This is a relic from the past - the decor has not been updated since it opened in 1946 and the owner cook has maybe been working here just as long . There are about ten seats in the entire place and they are all at the counter so this place is not good for groups . * Note the hours - 7am to 1pm (sometimes earlier) weekdays only . * I do not need to tell you that it cash only but you wo not need much of it . Our breakfasts were $6 each . The cash register looked like it was from the 19th century and it probably actually was . ',\n",
       " 'I m really excited that a new sit down Mexican restaurant has opened on my side of town . This is a small chain from Texas and the food is good if atypical Southwestern style Mexican food . Los Cucos cannot compete with Vegas local powerhouse Lindo Michoacan but it still has pretty good eats and great service . The interior is strange a rag - tag looking atmosphere in what is (obviously) a space formerly inhabited by MiMi Cafe . The Mardi Gras balcony is still there but now there some sparse randomly placed Mexican decor lining the walls . The restaurant feels spacious open and clean and there a particularly nice open bar area right inside the front door . The place lacks character but it a pleasant enough atmosphere . I had to laugh at the menu because it loaded with misspellings (\"crispi\" tacos \"romain\" lettuce) and some of the descriptions are exactly the same for different items (check out the special fajitas on the menu) . When I pointed this out to our server she could not explain it nor tell me which item it was that was the correct description . I eventually got what I wanted but the menu had the dish listed under two different names . You would think for a chain restaurant the menu would be consistent (and free of spelling errors) . As with most Mexican eateries the house serves complimentary chips and salsa . The chips were good enough but served cold ; the salsas are DELICIOUS . Like seriously delicious . There a spicy smoky red salsa that served warm and a fantastic avocado crema style cold salsa . Both of these were the highlight of my meal and I am still craving them (they will make me return to the restaurant often) . We ordered the queso with shrimp as an appetizer . At $11 . 95 it overpriced . The cheese was not that warm when it was served and the queso was loaded with red onions mushrooms and other unnecessary stuff . The shrimp was seasoned well and quite delicious ; however I would not order this again . For lunch I ordered chicken fajitas and my husband ordered steak fajitas . The meat quality was top - notch . I LOVED the marinade on both of the meats and we both agreed the meat was some of the best in town . The fajita vegetables were just okay - - onions and poblano peppers . I was disappointed in the overall fajitas but I would love to have just the meat served on its own . I had fajitas that came \"loaded\" with bacon and cheese and it was an unusual and very tasty combo . The side plate was huge and had so so beans average rice and very tasty guacamole and pico de gallo . Fatty alert : they serve homemade flour tortillas and they are delicious ! I love Mexican restaurants that care enough to make legit tortillas and I m happy that Los Cucos does it right . I could have eaten two dozen of them ! It a bummer that they are not served in tortilla warmers to keep them soft but instead are plopped on the table sandwiched between paper towels . This means the tortillas get hard very quickly . Best to gobble them up as soon as possible ! After our lunch Jesus the manager came over to ask how we enjoyed everything . He was very eager to please and happy to listen to our suggestions . I was very impressed with this personal touch and the efficient friendly service we received . This is not the best Mexican food in Vegas but the kitchen uses very high quality ingredients the prices on most menu items are fair and the service is good . This is a great place to add to the dining rotation especially if you live near Mountain Edge and the Arroyo . ',\n",
       " 'What a trip to Canada without poutine? Back in the states I have seen many gourmet poutine creations inspired by Canada beloved poutine . In it basic form it composes of fries topped with cheese curd and gravy . To my surprise poutine can be found EVERYWHERE in Canada . . . basically any restaurant that has french fries whether it is a fast food chain or a mom and pop shop . While shopping at Vaughan Mills I knew I wanted to stop by their food court for some poutine before I flew back to the states . I decided to go to A&W since the A&Ws back home have closed down so I thought I would enjoy a nice Root Beer Float ($3 . 50 CAD) with my Poutine Fries ($4 . 50 CAD) . It was surprising that there was a long line waiting for A&W on a Monday morning and it was an even longer wait for such a simple order . There was a lot of workers behind the counter but I felt like they could have been more efficient . At long last I got my Poutine Fries ! ! It was really . . . salty . . . The gravy was incredibly salty and I think the best thing about this item was the cheese . The fries were on the soft side and it quickly became soggy under the gravy . I think this would have been more enjoyable if the fries were nice and crispy . On the other hand I really enjoyed my Root Beer Float . I happened to be in Toronto during the record breaking heat all year long so this was a nice cool treat . The Root Beer here was less sweet and less carbonated than the A&W back in the states so I really enjoyed it with the vanilla ice cream . Just as the Chopped judges were saying on Canadian Food Network channel I felt like A&W was \"pedestrian\" but I guess that is to be expected for a fast food restaurant . Except . . . they were not fast at all . . . ',\n",

Because I mentioned that it was my first ever visit they gave me a free order of garlic dough knots . Now that was real cool and unexpected . When I walked in the atmosphere was friendly from the staff though I felt awkward when the 6 or so customers in the restaurant all stopped and turned to see who was coming in . . . . I suppose my presence has that effect on people . I mean I WAS wearing these awesome sunglasses . My fave . Maybe I looked like a celebrity . . . Imagine the light hitting my face just right and the draft from the door blowing my hair in just the right direction . . . Yeah that was it . I am a celebrity . For a hot second . All right all right - the dream is over . Back to the pizza : My slice of pepperoni was good . The crust had a good balance of crisp and soft all the way through the sauce tasted authentic though forgettable and the pepperoni looked generic but had the right amount of crisp to it and no floating grease . That important . The real downer were the dough knots . Ew . I was looking forward to these . The instructions on the Styrofoam container said something like \"heat for 30 seconds in microwaveable container . \" I did that and ended up with overheated extra tough dough knots . Boo . My previous pizza - by - the - slice restaurant nearest me moved or closed or something . It was my favorite . So I was hoping to find an alternative . Jury still out on that one . . . I could easily give my experience 2 stars . BUT three stars for the free dough knots (even though I threw them away) . The gesture was thoughtful enough to warrant a return visit .

       " 'Went there today 6 - 21 - 15 for lunch . Stood awkwardly at the front for about 5 minutes before anyone could be bothered to take my order . I got a three piece chicken tender combo . When I hear \"combo\" I automatically think fries and a drink . . . . not the case here . A combo is just the tenders fries and cole slaw . I thought that was weird . . . especially since the combo was over $12 . So I got the \"combo\" with a root beer and asked for my fries loaded (topped with sour cream cheese and bacon) . The total was almost twenty bucks . . . more than I want to spend for lunch . The place was pretty busy and there were only four open tables but they were all dirty . I just sat down anyways . . . cuz that how I roll . A little chicken crumbs never hurt anybody and I do not want to be \"that lady\" and ask to have the table wiped down . These tenders were not good ya will . Yes they were fresh they were hot they were moist but there is a weird dry rub on the outside and the inside is really bland . I could easily make these in my kitchen . They have many sauces to try to disguise their bland chicken :1) Habanero hot sauce - Just gross . No tanginess at all . . . just sweet and slightly spicy . Skip it . I much prefer Frank Red Hot or buffalo sauce . 2) Barbecue - Standard barbecue sauce . . . tastes just like the kind you get at the grocery store . 3) Wasabi honey - This is literally wasabi - flavored honey . It is watery and disgusting and I do not know who in the world likes this . 4) Wildflower honey - Once again . . . . this is just plain honey . Who is dipping their chicken in honey? This place does not even have biscuits so I dunno why they have honey . 5) Chipotle barbecue - See #2The coleslaw was awful . I actually spit it out . It just cabbage carrots and vinegar . Yuck . The fries were delicious . The root beer was delicious . Cane is about twenty times better and half the price . I have no reason to go back here . If I ever did end up back here I would try something else . . . like maybe the wings or a sandwich . The tenders are not worth it . *update* When I ate there I asked the cashier if I could substitute the cole slaw for the pickled cucumbers and I was denied but I have read a couple of yelp reviews where yelpers were allowed to do this .

You are not bringing it hard enough . The only thing wild was the crying women in the bathroom . I cannot explain that . But aside from Cleveland finest clientele the place did not have a drink menu . Not even a margarita menu . For the love of tacos how do you not have a margarita on the menu when you are called \"Wild Margaritas?\" As far as food Please remove the pounds of onions from the beef . That in excess of the daily onion intake required for a taco . And whatever cleaner you are using please switch because the smell of cleaning product was intense . So intense I swore I tasted fabuloso in my drink and i just could not take more than a few sips . It continued to taste weirder as i kept drinking it . I thought I was being roofied by a ghost . You can turn this around Wild Margaritas . Bring us that snazzy margarita menu . Switch the odd PowerPoint with a fun video of margarita making or maybe a beautiful beach in Mexico and do not use scotch tape to hang decor . I know this place is new so I m hoping in a few months things will be up and running . But as a Latina just visiting the area for a week i have to say this initial visit was disappointing .

So great was the flavor and sear that I worked hard to stop myself at eating half to save the other half for Mom to try .

Food prices run a bit high but it HUGE portions 3 - 4 star in quality and has a wide menu . I like it for various reasons ; food is only partial . Good for late night . ',\n",
       " 'I had high hopes for Hot Head Burritos and was excited when it opened because it in the shopping center on GV PKWY & Horizon Ridge with the Sprouts & Target I frequent ; and I am always up for good Mexican food . I was surprised to find the place empty when we came in for lunch at about 12 :30 on a workday . Never a good sign . A friend and I decided to share a barbacoa burrito and the taco meat (ground beef) nachos but as we began to order an older gentleman walked in and we were told that they were going to quickly make his order before ours . This was bizarre but he seemed to be a friend of the franchise owner . Still a terrible business practice . Once we did order I immediately regretted the nacho choice . They layer the chips in a Styrofoam container and add the toppings including shredded cheese . They top it with melted queso but that is not enough to melt the shredded cheese or warm any of the other toppings . You are left with a cold congealed mess that is not appetizing . They have no way to heat the nachos so this is not something that can be changed . Our burrito was okay but nothing special (heavy on the rice) and I was a little peeved that fajita veggies were a $2 up charge . I may give it a second chance but it wo not be my first choice .

       " 'We were in the area and were quite hungry but did not want to settle on food court food in Sundridge Mall so we decided to go and eat at Sumo . Well we did not have high expectations but still the food quality went below that . The service was great and the severs were all friendly but the overall food quality and price was not worth it . Way too expensive for the kind of food they serve . We spent $170 for 5 people . We ordered takoyaki bbq squid and calamari for starters . Then we ordered dynamite roll California roll a specialty roll 3 bentos and yakisoba . None of which were that good - some dishes were too salty oily and some did not seem to be seasoned at all . Probably wo not come back and if in the area or shopping in the mall - I definitely recommend to settle for some food court food instead of paying more money for the same quality of food . ',\n",
       " 'With a few Create - Your - Own Pizza joints here in town finding one that actually stands out from rest is hard to find . I have been to Pieology and between both I see no difference . Both spots were good both boasts fresh ingredients both are priced around the same range both are quick to cook . This place was kind of lacking cleanliness tho . Me and my kid went here after the trunk or treat event last night and a bunch of tables were dirty . It looked like they had a slim crew because the guy who took my initial pizza order doubled as the cashier which is at the end of the ordering process . But either than that nothing really different . Their kids meals does have healthy options of if your kid wants to live dangerously they can get oreo cookies instead . Again nothing really bad about this place . Food was good service was ok and they have those kewl coke machines . ',\n",

I tried their namesake DIY Specialty Bowl and the ingredients did not really work well together and did not seem all that fresh . Pricing is high for the portion compared to other similar businesses but there also a ton of rice resulting in less toppings . Service was friendly and location is spacious but if I m wanting a poke bowl in the area there are other options I would pick first . ',\n",

       " 'Here to you mr . neighborhood - sports - bar - floor - manager ! They were training a new server who was from New York so she came replete with a touch of attitude and not enough training . Thankfully middle management saved the day ! The question was whether the nachos (do NOT order by the way they are borderline inedible but then i do not particularly like nachos under the best of circumstances) contain beans even if you order them with chicken instead of refried beans on top . Somehow someway we got confused and assumed they did . Our server upon being complained at simply walked away without a word . Needless to say there were comments made at our table . That when middle management stepped in . He explained that it an either - or proposition enlightening us . He then went above and beyond bringing us a cup of the delicious refried beans (which I tried despite my distaste for the whole nacho thing and found to be completely and totally 100% awesome) . Thank you sir ! At some point I ordered a burger which I wholeheartedly enjoyed . It enjoying me right now quite enthusiastically I might note . *gurgle*Anyway I do not have a great feeling about this place future in my repertoire of places to drink . If the unsung hero is not there to help you out the service will not be good . No attitude per se just poor service which is possibly more unforgivable in my book . The perfect storm is poor service with attitude but for that you gotta go to Pomeroy (can we go back there again soon so I can find justification to SLAM that place in my update? please?) The environment is typical sports bar with a moderately clean bathroom (thank you again unsung hero ! ) . The food is very uneven even for a sports bar . Those fries should not be heavily salted . I do not care who likes them that way I will not eat them covered in salt . I will not eat them with a malt . I do not like them not one bit ! Anyway I do not have any particularly hostile feelings towards this place . My burger was good the beer selection was decent and the prices were (in theory at least) great . Give that floor manager a fancy set of whip and chains and . . . I dunno redecorate? somehow import some atmosphere someway i do not know or care how and this place will get more stars . I should note that I am quite sure they messed up my check . The beers were supposed to each be $4 in fact I carefully ensured that each beer I ordered (ok that might be a total lie) was a $4 beer and yet my bill came to $26 . I only had three plus a nine - dollar burger . I do not think they were trying to rip me off but as a cheap person I find this slightly offensive . Granted I m partially to blame for not I dunno reading the bill when I got it? anyway I will forgive you this time Gallagher but you are on my watch list . You eff me over one time you win an all - expense paid trip to the Gitmo of my \"recommended avoid\" list . Consider yourself warned . ',\n",
       " 'Buca of Yorkville a total rip off when an Oyster is sold for $7 . Yes $ 7 per Oyster . No disclosure on the the faintly printed menu which one cannot even read and the font size is challenging to the 20 20vision . So I flashed the light from my IPhone and read Oyster offering in 3 ways . Deception as the menu does not tell you how many Oysters . Three ways means 3 different varietals . As a sophisticated diner I am embarrassed to ask how many Oysters in a serving . So I assume that if the world famous restaurant Jean George or La Bernadine in New York City or Madame Darroze In London can offer at $3 . 50 a piece I will be getting at least 6 for the listed price of $21 at Buca . No I got only 3 for $21 . I know my restaurants in Toronto and around the world . I travel all over the globe for food and wine and visit only the best . No one has sold me an Oyster for $7 a piece . The restaurant is about ripping off customers and profitability . There is not one single wine on the list that I recognized . Restaurants practice this art so that the customer does not have a bench mark . So what do you do? You order and pay the rip off price . My main was a pasta dish . It arrived cold . The waiter was very polite and immediately replaced it with a warm substitute . She was most considerate to the discomfort caused and was apologetic . I went to Buca Yorkville because I am a fan of Buca on King Street West . So I thought it will be the same experience in Yorkville . . It was not . The chain restaurants do not offer the same experience on different locations . Buca in Yorkville is a disaster and a total rip off offering a single Oyster at $7 . I went to Buca Yorkville based on the review conducted by Joanne Kates . We Canadians are a very polite nation . We will clap on anything . We even call Pusateri the Fauchon of Canada . I remember my days in the 60 when Toronto was one of the test markets for Broadway plays including Philadelphia and Westchester county NY . Toronto audience clapped on everything Westchester was brutal in awarding a nod and Philly was in between . We continue to maintain our polite posture ( thank God for that) and will welcome a new comer like the Buca of Yorkville . Well rip us all the way and we will welcome you . Cheers Toronto and Joanne Kates . Suresh Chawla . ',\n",

The chef is friendly and any dietary restrictions can be accommodated without sacrificing flavor . They also do meal prep . Healthy and convenient . . . if you can find it . The location inside the CSN food court means you are unlikely to stumble in without knowing about it and for whatever reason they do not have any posted hours so I have found them closed more often than not . The salad and wrap I got were both good but it was a customized order out of necessity when three things I tried to order could not be made because ingredients were out of stock in the kitchen . A little advertising and a bit more attention and this place could be even better . ',\n",

I think they are now $2 but still definitely get you messed up and are tasty enough for only 2 bucks . It puts some people off that the margaritas are poured from a tap like a draft beer but once you have two or three you are fine with it . I witnessed such a lady make an issue with the draft margarita who insisted on having it shaken in a cocktail shaker . The bartender reassured the senorita that this was the house margarita that everyone was enjoying . She just could not wrap her head around it . I wanted to say \"Listen lady Its $2 . . . and it will get you fucked up just enjoy it\" ! But my reserved nature dictated otherwise . The atmosphere and the food are above average standard Sonora Mexican fare that is not very spicy . The location is ideal if your buddie girlfriend is having a baby at John C . Lincoln hospital and you want to have the \"Holy Shit ! your a Dad\" talk over 3 pitchers of margaritas .

       " 'This is the second time that our hiking group has stopped at the Galleria Mall Food Court after a hike to enjoy some food and social time . As it turned out both times everyone got food from the Kyklos Greek Cafe rather than one of the other outlets . I ordered a beef gyro with an order of fries and with \"everything\" added to the meat - - shredded lettuce tomatoes tzatziki onion and feta . There were nine of us but just one worker when we got there . The one person soon got a helped when the 11 :30 hour arrived but the one did almost everything himself and he was very efficient . The sandwich is certainly tasty and very filling . Also make sure you get extra napkins . With the tzatziki and all the vegetables I got it was take a bite wipe your hands and mouth and then repeat . I think next time I will get it as a platter . For food court fare this is quite good Greek food . The sandwich is made from fresh ingredients save for the pre - cooked beef and chicken which are heated on a grill before constructing the sandwich . The price for the meal is reasonable . This is a solid choice and worth a detour if you want to give some Greek food a try . ',\n",
       " 'This is based on the \"groupon deal\"DO NOT purchase the Groupon . This is completely false advertising . I purchased the 4 people option . The food is decent and ect . But I do not like being lured to a place for the wrong reasons . Basically you think you are getting this wonderful deal but at the end of your dinner you are hit with taxes and gratitude for party of 4 . Oh yeah how convenient right have you heard of any restaurant of gratitude for 4 people? I have never . And maybe there are some out there maybe for HIGH END restaurants . So the \"gratitude ect . \" comes out to be around $40 . When we ask for the menu and prices . First there is no written menu so they can change their price whenever they feel like it . Secondly do you know how much is it to go there regularly without a coupon per person? It is around $43 now multiple this by 4 it equals $172 now minus $132 (Groupon deal) and add the $40 of \"gratitude\" = $172 . Does not take a genius . This Groupon should say free wine and dessert and NOT say you are getting half off of the food . Such a lie ! If you go just go without the coupon but from what I read and seen this place is just a trap for groupons . No wonder they are so strict on reservations they know they need to have plenty of room for the poor Groupon people . More on the food there is not much variety on meats some taste dry . The salad bar is basic you probably get better salad from hometown buffet . The only good thing was the free \"wine\" which according to the waitress it costs $22 I looked online it was about $5 . So done . ',\n",

This was my first time to Gold Spike . . .

We never managed to utilize the bed for the pillow fight but our group got down with some 4 square and corn hole . The playground was larger than I thought it would be with lots of offerings including beer pong humongous chess twister tether ball etc . When my love and I went down with some friends on a Friday night there was a live band playing . We were in a large party of over a dozen people but just like playground fashion would have it we ended up playing with strangers and making new friends . . . a fun and easy way to wind down after a week of work . Gold Spike is right in the heart of downtown and we found a mix of lots of tourists and locals when we came . GS is perfect for a large group but even a small party could have a great time .

       " 'I m not sure why I m giving it 2 stars instead of 1 . I think Maybe a different pizza would be better?I got this pizza I forget the name but it had red peppers and onions and Parmesan . I got it minus the Parmesan . It came back looking delicious . At first bite it was good the onions were sweet and tasty . . . . . . but then I tasted that first there was no sauce which it did not mention on the menu . Then the after taste was over cooked butter and bad garlic . They smear butter in between the crust and the cheese . Cheese and butter make an awful combo . I wish the butter and horrible garlic were not on there . It was ruining the otherwise good pizza . I m mean it was so bad I could not eat it . I got a salad too the Emilia or something . It said it had pine nuts arugula Red onions and red peppers . Balsamic vinaigrette . OK you picture it loaded with pine nuts onions and peppers . It gets to the table and it a whole head of lettuce and like four shavings of a pepper and a thimble of pine nuts . I maybe saw 2 things of onion . I had the waitress bring the balsamic on the side and the lemon vinaigrette on the side . The dressings could have been good if they did not use whatever oil it was . I m like 90% sure it was soybean oil . It was a very strong flavor that was overpowering and bad real bad . I took like 2 bites . It was a really bad meal . I can see the potential and I will try a pizza with a sauce this next time . ',\n",
       " 'My rating of this place went downhill with each subsequent night . We stayed 5 nights total . The good : The lobby and grounds are beautiful . The room and bathroom are spacious . The air conditioning works really well . I started with a 4 or 5 - star first impression despite the long Disneyland type winding line to check in and the sales job to then get you to pay more for a room with a view . Got to our room and we were wowed by the spaciousness complete with sunken living room . TVs in the living room bedroom and bathroom . Wow . Huge marble bathroom . Then you notice the 1970s couch that looked disheveled enough that I never wanted to sit on it for fear of what stains I would be connecting with . Then night falls and you turn on all the lights . Every . last . one . And yet you still cannot see . Then you wait thinking they must be the type that slowly warm up and get brighter . It was literally still dark in the toilet area when you turned the light on . I could never see my face well enough to put on make - up easily . And the lighted make - up mirror never worked despite us leaving a note every single day . They had a mini fridge but it was fully stocked and you paid even if you just picked something up and did not use it . The charge went through based on the shifting weight . This meant we could not put our own water food or drinks in the fridge . I hated that . I am not a fan of only flat sheets on beds . I like fitted sheets over the mattress so you do not risk having the mattress pad exposed and your body touching it or the mattress . This was the case here . It grossed me out . Then fast - forward to our last day and housekeeping never came to our room . We got back around midnight and needed to pack and shower and we could do nothing until they came to make the beds and replace the towels . They put us on a list and said they would try to be there in 20 minutes . WHAT?? 45 minutes later they had made up and refreshed our linens . Even after talking to a manager twice NOTHING was done to expedite the service and nothing was taken off our exorbitant final bill . The clock radio never worked . And a weird thick layer of dust covered it and my iPhone every single morning . Gross . So my impression of this place went downhill night after night . I wo not be a return customer . ',\n",
       " 'Two words ~ mushy rice Walking into this place I have to say that I loved the vibe . The restaurant itself is beautiful with so many great details from the modern finishes to the art . We were walked upstairs and that space was equally as great as the sushi bar downstairs . Service was good too . I noticed that the lunch specials were really expensive on paper $16 - 18 for their sushi plates but we ordered them anyway as the reviews for this place were great . Presentations were very nice & you did receive a lot of food . The fish was fresh & each plate came with a few pieces of sashimi which were really good but everything else that had rice was nearly inedible . The rice was mushy and packed so hard that each piece was really heavy . I could not get passed that . I had high hopes & wanted to love my experience because I genuinely enjoyed the space but the rice ruined it for me and let be honest the rice is just as important as what comes on it or in it when it comes to sushi .

You are telling me this place is not an elaborate prank on unsuspecting diners? Well dang . Then this might just be the single worst Italian dining experience from a local Italian restaurant I have ever had . From the service to the overpriced mediocre food to the atmosphere this place is a total and complete bust . The server we had was completely unhelpful and literally would not take our appetizer order until we ordered the entire meal because they were \"really busy and could not handle it . \" (Yes really a direct quote . Mind you that all the tables were not even full and this was a Friday evening . . . so I do not even understand what would happen if you went on a less staffed night . ) The food was horrible from the appetizer to the entree and we could not even stomach risking spending another penny on dessert because the entire meal was so blah . I do not know if it policy or not at this restaurant but my water was brought out and never once filled again and looking around at the other tables this was the case for them as well . The inside is a weird combination of decorations and the outside patio sits right in the middle of a parking lot . . . no ambiance in either location . I could probably go on and on and on about how horrible this place is but the bottom line is this : avoid at all costs . Hell go buy a bottle of Ragu at the next door Harris Teeter and save yourself the money and agony of dining at this establishment . I can assure you you would not notice the difference . ',\n",

When I watched those types of movies I always thought \"man real life cannot possibly be like this . No one parties like they do in the movies\" . Rest assured that Encore Beach Club is just like the movies . . . and even better . Top name DJs (the day I went Chainsmokers were there) ; attractive crowd ; dancing ; imbibing . You name it this place has it . I would go on but at the risk of losing my Yelp Elite badge I will keep this review family friendly . Yes it expensive for guys . Yes it crowded . Yes if you get there late the lines are long . Does not matter . Just go . Protip : buy a waterproof phone . Trust me it is worth it . My Galaxy S8 was a champ that day . Protip : the big name DJs usually come on mid afternoon . . . 3ish? So you do not want to get to the club super early . I think if you aim to get there 1130 - 12 you should be ok . Protip : bring an empty water bottle - they will let you bring it in and you can refill it at the water fountain as often as you want . Protip : if you see everyone hurrying out of the pool . . . there is probably a very good reason and you should follow suit . ',\n",
       " 'This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas . Also it is close to my home so that is ALWAYS a plus . The food is flavorful SPICY (if you ask for it) and high quality . Some of my favorite things to order are the Pad See Ew Tom Kah Crab Rangoons Sweet and Sour Chicken and the Chicken Panang . I m sure there are more amazing things on the menu . I just happen to fall in love with certain entrees and cannot seem to order anything else . The prices are very reasonable considering the quality is awesome AND the portions are larger than most Thai restaurants . Usually I find myself not having any leftovers at most places but here I can always bring home a bunch and let it feed me for a few days . Servie is quick and friendly . My one criticism is something they cannot change . The place is small and busy . So sometimes you may have to order take out rather than eat in . But who cares ! As long a I get to stick my face in some Thai food I do not care where I do it . Happy to see some yummy locally owned and operated Thai food in this area . ',\n",

They have a relaxed atmosphere and I like that they play music videos on multiple tv screens . The hookah was only $10 and one of the servers suggested blue mist mixed with orange and I really liked it . The food and drinks were mediocre . . . . I ordered 2 margaritas and did not even have a buzz after . My friend ordered Hennessy & Sprite and it was also watered down .

All of these items were not good . Also water was not free . Honestly I was surprised at how little we were teased and heckled by our server .

       " 'LAZY DOG DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR PETS . They put onions in my friends dog dish and placed it on the patio floor . I did not order food for my dog . Only a water bowl . Onions contain an ingredient called thiosulphate which is toxic to cats and dogs . The ingestion of onions causes a condition called hemolytic anemia which is characterized by damage to the red blood cells . Onion toxicity can cause the red blood cells circulating through your pet body to burst . Symptoms of this condition include breathlessness lethargy diarrhea and vomiting . Lazy dog did not research what can harm and possibly kill dogs before deciding to serve them - their management kitchen and servers were NOT trained . Catching up with my friend over dinner - I look down and discover my dog is not drinking his water from his water bowl but instead in my friends dog food bowl which was pushed over to my side of the table by her dog . I keep my dog on a half length leash so he cannot wander all over . I initially freak out - then rationalize and think \"well ok lazy dog would not put anything in the dog bowl that could hurt them . It is a dog friendly restaurant\" I stated I do not feed my dog human food . This does not mean \"I was cool with it\" or did not do anything to stop it . \" Lazy dog has chosen to misinterpret my words into saying \"I was cool with it and gave him permission to eat the food\" I never verbally said I was ok with him eating the food . It simply meant I was not going to let it ruin my dinner and become angry . I explicitly did not willingly allow my dog to eat out of the bowl with my knowledge . In fact my friends dog was growling at my dog for even being near his bowl . My dog reacted severely shortly after and rushed him to the dog hospital . He could not breathe and was struggling to vomit . I notified a small piece of clear onion in his vomit . As a result of onion toxicity reaction - he aspirated when trying to vomit . This means vomit got in his lungs and would cause pneumonia . He was in the emergency room for 24 hours on IV antibiotics . The female manager was rude and did not care when I asked what they put in the dog food bowl . She showed zero empathy when I stated my dog could not breathe as I was rushing him to the er . I needed what ingredients were in the bowl to report to my vet ASAP upon arrival . Per their manager \"we will feed your dogs whatever\" Lazy dog did not show any empathy or concern over my dogs health . They did not call the next day to see if he made if through the night . Lazy dog then sends us to their claims adjuster from Argo group . To proceed with the process he states a recorded interview must take place . Their claims adjuster interpreted my words as \"I was cool with it ! I have your recorded interview ! \" Raised his voice with me and stated I acted negligently and he would of done anything to protect his dogs implying I am a bad dog owner . I expressed my concerns to the claims adjuster the fact that their grills prepping and other cooking surfaces could be cross contaminated with several food items harmful to dogs given there was no knowledge or training . I asked \"how do consumers know the burgers for dogs are not grilled on the same surface as onions or garlic . How do consumers know there is not onion powder in the burgers you serve to dogs\" I expressed I wrote in to lazy dog corporate office one more time as I was disappointed to say the least and their claims adjuster exclaimed \"you will not be hearing from them ! I am speaking on their behalf ! \" I stated I did not think I was asking for much to speak with them . Lazy dog chose to hide behind their claims adjuster who raised his voice at me misinterpreted my interview put words in my mouth and acted aggressively in our conversations when I tried to make sure other dogs would not be harmed in the future . Joel acknowledged the staff was not trained . I secret shopped their location in summerlin 2 months after the fact and the waiters still were not trained as to what is toxic for dogs when I inquired . This incident took place in april . I secret shopped in may . It is now end of June . I have been biting my tongue patiently before writing this post to give them the opportunity to rectify the situation . I have given lazy dog every opportunity to act with integrity and do the right thing . Technical legalities aside - I am NOT looking to sue for emotional distress or bank any extra cash . I am looking for my full vet bills to be compensated and a simple apology . Lazy dog is not capable of this . Lazy dog offered $1000 which does not cover all my vet bills in exchange for signing a contract to silence me and not allow me to speak about this incident with anyone . They covered my friends vet bills in full who ordered the dog food . I am not biting my tongue anymore . Anything you have to say to continue to point the finger at me lazy dog only makes you look worse . ',\n",
       " 'What a wonderful experience for me . I had planned all winter to visit this resto . My friend and I kept trying to set a date that would work in Mar Apr this year . With it being the high season here in AZ we had to book about 4 weeks in advance to get a decent seating time on a weekend night . So we booked our date . A week out my friend has a family situation that came up and could not make it . Well I waited all that time (not including the time it finally took for us to settle on a date) I sure as hell was not going to cancel the dinner JUST because my friend could not go . Ok so this is definitely not the type of place one would expect to see a woman sitting along eating dinner . NO WAY . This place has the most romantic quiet and beautiful patio dining room . With it being April the patio dining room was in full effect and in walks . . . ME . . solo . Dressed to the nines in my 5 inch heels and dress and etc as if I were meeting someone . . Nope . . . table for 1 . I am seated right away and this is when I began to really sit back and enjoy myself . Every person that came to my table called me by name Ms D can I get you some more Tea? Ms D how was the this and Ms D can we get you a that? Oh man all that fuss over me made me feel like a true princess . Chef Chris even came by twice and commented that he was happy I had decided to come anyway . I was too . My meal was very good . A week or so before the dinner Chef Chris personally called me to ask what types of foods we did not like and what we liked . I said Chilean sea bass is my favorite fish and I generally enjoy fish . I forgot to mention that the only thing I really HATE is fennel and caraway seeds - like PLEASE DO NOT PUT THAT IN MY DISHES . How I manged to forget that important detail is beyond me ! So its the dinner night . . . . On my drive to dinner I remember thinking to myself how could I forget that i HATE fennel and caraway seeds . I thought what are the chances that he would have fennel or caraway seeds in the dish? I shrugged it off and thought \"naaaah\" . Get to dinner and discover they had Chilean Seabass (Yeaaa ! ) with you guessed it blanched fennel and etc . My heart sank because I do not really eat beef which was the other option . so I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass . I figured I could possibly remove anything with fennel in it and just eat the fish . To my surprise the fish comes out and you guessed it I LOVED it . Fennel and all . I was shocked . I ate EVERY bite of that fish . Chef Chris told me that blanching fennel calms down the flavor and he was right . It was actually extremely pleasant . Any place that can make me like fennel and cause me to start cooking the fennel in my CSA basket at home deserves a minimum 4 stars . They get a bonus star for the stellar service . I think I will return for a b would ay dinner . . . alone in the next couple of weeks . I m due for some food pampering . Bravo Chef Chris and staff ! ',\n",
       " 'Let get 1 thing straight . I love In N Out ! so it pains me to write this . . . I have had it in several states in the last 14 years . Its still one of my favorite spots . People seem to get overly excited about the secret menu and that nice and all but it nothing new far from secret and definitely not a game changer . . . funny how people love to be in the know of anything that supposedly \"secret\" . . it not illuminati folks ! . . . lol . . (extra crispy fries animal style protein style etc etc) yes its good stuff but lets face it the bragging rights component is far more important (to most people) than anything you will consume cause again it not overwhelmingly great . . . it good though . I just laugh when I witness first hand the smugness and self satisfaction people experience as they share this \"life altering news\" as if they know some secret MI6 agent behind the counter that can \"hook them up cause they are special\" . . . like disney dust to a 5 year old . . all because they know the secret \"language\" lol . . (out of towners that might have In N Out twice a year become cool kids all of a sudden) . . . . . . Jheer ahsum dewd ! Ok so now that we have that out of the way I would have given the review 5 stars since In N Out is one of my top 3 burgers (along with Dicks in Seattle and 5 Guys) however the service at this specific location is so poor I had to average the score . I have been to this location since they first opened years ago and this place has really suffered a major decline . . Service here especially at night really sucks . They take waaaaaaaaaaay longer than usual to fulfill your order the place is never clean homeless constantly pan handle at this location (they stand right next to the entrance and pan handle) and mgmt does nothing about it . The funny thing is by comparison they are not THAT busy ! Is it because they are under staffed? Whatever it is it VERY noticeable if you have ever eaten at In n Out before . The pedestrian drive thru order taker is rarely there and when they are they cannot get to the entire line since the signal range on their device only goes up to 5 ft from the normal drive through speaker box (so what the F is the point? ! ? ! ?) Several times I will provide my order to this drive thru walker only to have them say \"I m sorry sir but something is wrong with our mobile system just pull forward and provide them your order\" . . an absolute waste of time further delaying the experience . . . . . Other things that have happened here on several occasions : incorrect change given incorrect order (who the hell messes up a plain cheeseburger?) overcharged cold and stale fries rude service always forgetting items salt ketchup napkins (drive thru) and massive delays . . . to name a few . If I were to sum up THIS SPECIFIC In N Out location it would be to compare it to that of a McDonald . . . . IN A WALMART ! And If you do not know what I m talking about go to any Walmart in Las Vegas and dine in at the built in McDonalds they all have them . It what it sounds like and what you would expect . Shitty on many levels . Sub Par even for Fast Food Standards . . . Bottom Line : Save yourself some trouble and skip this location head to Five Guys which is just up the road less than 2 mins north on LVB or if you are set on In N Out head to the Ft Apache or Tropicana location .

       " 'I will go with a 3 . 5 rating rather than a 4 but because the flavors were so outstanding I will bump them up to the flat 4 . Service was confusing not in a bad way in a \"everything looks and sounds like I want to cram all of it in my mouth right now\" way . Too bad they have the entire fixins laid out in front of you which propelled me to add sausage to the quattro formaggi . That much cheese . . . this kid needs some meat to make the magic work and I anticipated saltiness which some sweet sausage might help balance but more on that to come ! We ordered 2 apps and 3 pizzas . The first to arrive were the Quattro Formaggi and the Zucca . The Zucca was the one my dining partner heard about and it was \"a must . \" It looked gorgeous and I decided to nosh that one first . Well played and well ordered . Fresh mozz butternut squash caramelized onion bacon . . . SCORE ! ! ! If I remember correctly neither of us even knew there was bacon on it but if you say bacon I put on facepaint and a loin cloth and dance around an open fire gratefully praying to pagan gods . True story . No it not but close . The flavors were fantastic . FAN - TASTIC . So much so I completely ignored the fact it was fairly oily and incredibly limp . Limp as in pick it up and it droops down like grandpas brown polyester pants . My grandpa does not wear those but I heard yours does ! Heeey - oooh ! All said and done this pie was tops disregarding my very recent nitpicking and douchebaggery . Next I put on my water wings and dove into the quattro formaggi WITH sausage . If salt had a fist I just got punched by it . I am not down by any means with this consistent socially acceptable wave of \"Salt salt salt salt\" BUT . . . . . this was saltiness from mucho cheese and I mucho like mucho cheese . If it was the plain pie as is I m not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much . We had the sausage which helped plenty but I think to send it over the top possibly some pepperoni and or chili flakes to add some heat or pepper to counteract that wonderful cheese and make a harmonious balance of divinity would have been the best choice . As the previous pie oily and limp . But taste made up for it . The meatballs and the Margherita came out . Meatballs . . . . maaaaaaan . . . the meatballs came out in a little silver whatchamadoodle like straight out of the oven . Gorgeous bright red marinara (the sauce btw killer) and the tops of the balls were burnt not brown but black and that black . . . . ooooh boy I m telling you . Sent dem balls to the stratosphere . . . as in the sky not the hotel casino . Meatballs are outrageous and a must order . MUST ORDER ! ! ! The Margherita had enormous bits of tomato . Multi colored and quartered . This one also unfortunately limp and soggy but like the others flavor stood out more . And now the sad part of our story . I made the mistake of trying the burrata last . After I ate enough to lose some interest in food . In this was a great folly . The burrata was something I would have enjoyed leaps and bounds more if I ate it first as I was supposed to . Luckily I m still alive and can do things properly on my next go . I loved the hotel and this is a great place for grab n go dinner or lunch . Texture fails but taste dons body armor with shield and sword and wins out . Definitely on the cheaper side as well . 3 . 5 to a 4 . Ca not argue with the place . ',\n",
       " 'It 3am on a Wednesday morning and you cannot walk straight . With a stomach that only known a liquid diet for the last six hours you tell your DD this will be much better than Jack in the Box . The night been full of questionable decisions . . . one more could not hurt right?La Salsita has a nice array of different meats and veggies all ready to be loaded into a tortilla . If you want something quick like a burrito it like Chipotle for people who are not afraid of Mexicans . ',\n",
       " 'Okay meatballs . My average lunch ticket here ($18) on several visits far exceed my usually allocation for daily work lunch ($10 average) . Foodwise I have had :Meatball panini with dipping sauce - probably the better item versus the other below choices . Reason being is that the sandwich must be pressed in a panini press forcing out a hot sandwich . Still hungry after having this . 3 . 5 stars . Meatballs over pasta (Saucy Balls with pasta option) . Meatballs taste okay with the spicy meatballs having the most flavor . Meatballs in all visits are never hot and lukewarm at best . 2 . 5 starsTater tots : good . Crunchy and crispy . If I crave tator tots I will come here . Probably will not return due to cold meatballs and high lunch prices for non - filling satisfying content . ',\n",
       " 'This is the customer service . \"Excuse me . This tuna sashimi is cut really thick (like tongue ! ! )\"Answer - \"Oh . Ok we cut it thinner next time you come in\" Ha Ha Ha . Next time ! ??This place is for people who do not know sushi . Sadly it was the only place we could find downtown and the reviews were misleading . If you have never had sushi before and all you eat are rolls covered in mayo and sauce then this may be your place . If you seek out sashimi or nigiri then you best move on . We tried 8 different pieces and to cap off the lousiness of the preparation we were served the most rubbery Ebi I have had outside of a vending machine in Japan . WAIT . That Ebi was much better . I still cannot get over the response to the sashimi question . No adjustment or replacement . Just a promise for a visit that will never happen . I hope enough people read this review to put them off this experiment . It was the equivalent of sushi Panda Express . Spend your money on slots and a hot dog instead . ',\n",
       " 'We had a really rough experience here . In the end it hits none of the restaurant trifecta which I have just invented : experience food and price . You gotta have two . This place honestly had none on the night we visited and I wo not likely return . It was honestly the most disappointing meal I have had out in a long time . Aside from being the second most self - consciously decorated restaurant I have ever been in (see also : Weslodge) there are major issues with the super fun \"order off the chalkboards ! \" menu approach . You cannot see one from a bunch of different places in the restaurant . So we - and several other tables - ended up standing in the middle of a crowded cramped restaurant and yelling back to dining mates over the din trying to figure out what to order . Please please get over it and your schtick and get a printer or early century schoolhouse slates from the American Pickers website or wherever it is trendy restaurants are ordering their decor from so that people can order from any seat in the restaurant - if only for those handfuls of seats where it simply not possible to see your menus you need a better solution . They seem to be aware of the problem because the excruciatingly long and complete recitation of the menu from your server seems to be standard . It almost got to be hilarious . After saying quite clearly that we were starving - she began her diatribe - which is not limited to a listing of the menu items . Each individual menu is hyped up with elaborate descriptions and personal opinions (of course everything is FABULOUS right?) It is literally impossible to retain 90% of the stuff your server has to say particularly when you insist on listing every single garnish in every single taco . This is an absolutely critical thing that the owner needs to address right away . It is truly bizarre and I am as you see not the only person to be perplexed (and irritated) by this . To add insult to injury our server proceeded to give glowing and elaborate descriptions of dishes that were not even on the menu but had been really good a few weeks ago? And after 7 straight minutes of verbal gastro diarrhoea she completely failed to assist in ordering a sufficient amount of food . A JUST AMAZING shrimp curry recommended as an entree ended up being two shrimp (seriously) in a pool of thin sauce . So . Bad on experience on several levels . Guac was fine chips were the best part of the meal . The \"INCREDIBLE watermelon ceviche\" arrived first about a cup of chopped watermelon chunks and some soggy watery garnish . I understand that a ceviche is a dish that frequently has meat or fish in it . This dish did not . Why did it need to be nearly ten dollars?Tacos fell badly short completely inconsistent with the amounts of garnish far too much water - y stuff leaving us with messy soggy handfuls of shredded and disintegrated tortilla and warm meat . Proportioned all wrong with heaps of shredded veg totally obscuring everything else . Octopus taco was inedibly dry . The person who ordered it had a bite and rejected it the garbage can boyfriend who eats everything had a bit and rejected it I swooped in to try to finish it off and also found it inedible . When our server came to clear she noticed it was unfinished and did comp it . But honestly : three people could not finish a taco . You have a problem here . The proportioning of ingredients in a taco is something that Grand Electric does beautifully . More is not more . when you want to taste the primary filling less when it comes to garnishes is often more . And when more really IS more figure out a solution to make the thing edible by hand - Grand Electric does this by doubling the tortillas . Shrimp dish was as mentioned before overpriced and hilariously under portioned . So food was an issue . Dinner for four ran us well over $100 with tax and tip (three beers ordered total) and we left starving . ',\n",
       " 'Aye Dios Mios ! I think I have died and gone to carne asada heaven . The reviews were right Sonora Grill is astounding ! I was so impressed with everything I ordered . The carne asada hands down is the best in the valley . The shrimp was plump and flavorful the tortillas were fresh and the guacamole . . . Oh the guacamole . . . Mas deliciosa ! While the chips may not have been fresh they were still the perfect vehicle to scoop up the 3 salsas I devoured . I was even impressed with the rice and beans and usually these seem to be an afterthought in most Mexican meals . At Sonora they paid as much attention to the flavorful sides as the rest of the menu . Qué bueno ! The girl that helped us behind the counter was friendly and helpful and really knew her stuff . If I owned a restaurant I would try and steal her away ! This is a new favorite that is now in my regular rotation . ',\n",

       " 'Popped in for a cocktail last night with a friend . Neither of us were sure what to expect from Sierra Gold especially since neither of us are super into hanging out at a *casino* . The gaming scene here is light and there is plenty of empty bar top if you do not want the distraction . The venue is pretty classy no too smoky and there are loads of tables . We opted for a small table to the side of the bar . We were greeted pretty quickly and got drinks right away . Tried and true I opted for a Tito and soda while my friend enjoyed a brown ale of some sort . They offer two sizes of beer large and Big Gulp size . Seriously his beer was served in the biggest mug I have ever seen . I should also mention I do not get out much so perhaps this is a normal size mug . The music was a lot of 90 and early 2000 hip hop which I very much appreciate being in my mid 30 . Those were my jams . The drinks were dandy and reasonably priced and the food looks pretty legit . Pizzas wings as lot of staple bar food but a bit higher end . I have not eaten yet but if I make my way down to Sierra again I m totally getting a pizza . ',\n",
       " 'And with last night dinner my love of LV has lessened a fair bit . Specials prices continue to climb and at 15 bucks for a pile of soggy spaghetti - like noodles a weird sweet shrimp - tasting sauce and 6 pieces of tofu . . . well it just too much cash and sadness for a chef - boyardeed Viet classic . No sharp flavors . No texture . Just a limp pile of blech . Banh Xeo - still delish - but smaller less filling . Detached stuffings so an already challenging to eat plate becomes annoying . Corners are being cut here to the detriment of flavor but it wo not impact their mainstay clientele - which love the obsessive - servitude the \"you wo not like that try this\" attitude . The service has never been charming to me and it just not worth an arm in the face every 3 minutes if the food not up to par . Which for moi it is not any longer . Ah well . They will be fine .

       " 'I have been living in Las Vegas for years and for the longest time I would constantly drive by this place but never got the chance to check this place out . Truthfully whenever I think about bagels I would think about Einsteins and did not have the desire to stop by . However my sisters (fellow Yelpers) and I decided to try this place out since its been bookmarked in our Yelp all for a long time . From the moment you step into this place your transported back east to New York . The cafe set up is straightforward with a large dinning room on one side and a bakery deli on one side for takeout . There is a constant flow of people coming in and leaving . It apparent by the many awards and celebrity photos with autographs that this cafe is very popular . We ended up sitting in the dinning room and ordered 3 different omelette lol . A cool thing about the omelette dish it came with a choice of a side item . We all opted for the homestyle fries and was very pleased with the flavor and consistency of the seasoned potatoes (highly recommended) . Each dish came with a Bagel and Cream Cheese of your choice which was unexpected since our omelettes dishes were very sizable in portion . We ended up getting a plain everything and asiago bagel . All the bagels were fresh and delicious with no compliant just prepare yourself for a carb craze meal . The 3 omelettes we got were the Mushroom and Cheese Veggie and Spinach and Feta Cheese which was our favorite but they were all good . Overall we had a great experience and our server Kayla was good and knowledgeable about everything including the history of The Bagel Cafe . We will come back to try out more of their delicious food ! 2017 Yelp Review #25',\n",
       " 'Good assembly - line fast - casual dining for a menu item that often an afterthought in Mexican establishments . Come hungry and prepared to make *a LOT* of choices . There are around 8 different fillings ranging from vegetarian stuff to chicken to even bison . You can also pick from a myriad of toppings like guac cotija cheese or their ranch dressing which I would say has absolutely no business here if not for the novelty of being made from goat milk . Curiosity will get the best of me on that one ! Anyway I ordered a bison enchilada with red *and* green sauce (\"Christmas\" style) jack cheese guacamole and pickled onions . I mean just look at the picture I took ! You know you want to stuff your face with that . And if for some reason you do not share my amazing taste you will find something in here that right for you . And it wo not break the bank . And it wo not take long . Like seriously you cannot go wrong here ! ',\n",
       " 'First I need to talk about Savoy website get this off my chest . . . I strongly feel that any company website is a reflection of and extension of the company and that accordingly considerable effort should be put into the website . Savoy website does not cut it . This restaurant boasts about 10 dinner entrees that are $30 or more several that are nearly $40 and the website quality does not reflect that price point . The website is cheap - looking a disaster complete with uninspired fonts weird capitalization and formatting and an animated fire logo that conjures memories of 1990s computer graphics . And do not get me started on the establishment cheesy pretentious and unoriginal slogan \"The Good Life . \"That was a little harsh . Luckily the rest of this review is not . Our Groupon - powered recent dinners at Savoy - - 2 entrees and a dessert for just $49 - - did not disappoint . Overall the food was very good some of the best and most inspired I have had in a while . Wonderful flavors and quality ingredients . If you do not prefer a loud dining environment take note : a few days a week Savoy features live music and such was the case during our Monday (live jazz) and Thursday (other live music) dinners . Husband and I enjoyed the music but understand it not for everyone because it really very loud . Loved jazz night ; what an experience ! Savoy has its own parking lot which is nice but parallel parking along Penn Avenue in the evening after the vast majority of the Strip District shops have closed is usually no problem . A few points of criticism in addition to my website rant above . I found the linen napkin arrangements and the whole fresh - flowers - on - plate thing to be dated - - not in line with the look I think Savoy is going for . Also for some reason I just could not get over how poorly the artwork on the back wall had been hung and displayed . And speaking of the linen napkins the strangest thing happened during dinner #1 : I left my dirty napkin on my chair before I visited the restroom and when I returned I found that the napkin had been refolded and placed back on the table by a staff member sauce and lipstick marks in plain view . Something else that struck me as odd? My sparkling wine - - incidentally there is only 1 split option ($15) and 1 by the glass option ($13) - - was served in a cognac glass . I doubt I would return to Savoy for dinner at full price - - the décor needs a bit of an upgrade for me to truly appreciate a dining experience for 2 that can pretty easily exceed $200 - - but will certainly be on the lookout for future promotions like Groupon LivingSocial etc . And the Wednesday Thursday Friday 6 - 8PM Happy Hour featuring 1 2 priced apps and martinis and $3 beers sounds like a good time . ',\n",
       " 'My review of Imperial Market . Well this would have been 2 weeks ago . Friday afternoon 12pm . A friend and myself ventured in after seeing the place for a long time . We walked in 2 gentelman working . We stood in the \"lobby\" for a few minutes and decided to seat ourselves . I noticed a family of 4 eating but no one else in the building . After 5 more minutes watching one of the servers come in and deliver appetizers to said family I grabbed menus for my friend and myself . I read said menu and decided on the wonderful sounding corned beef sandwich on rye just like grandma used to make em . 10 minutes go by said server delivers entrees and drinks to said family of 4 . But not once does he look in our direction . Not once . So after a few more minutes we decide to leave no service you would do the same right? As we are walking through their store to get to parking lot in the rear one of the gentelman says \"Thanks guys . \" . REALLY??? What do you think we did to recieve such service? My grandparents were upstanding WELL respected members of Arizona Jewish community . And honestly would be apaulled by the way I was treated there . I have told several friends (and strangers for that matter) about my expierence there and have heard similar stories from a few of them . To think that a place like this for the people by the people would \"profile\" people and treat them with such disrespect . I will continue to rant about their poor service to anyone that will listen . Boy oh boy I wish my grandparents were around to hear this one . . . ',\n",
       " 'American hotdog with a unique Korean Hawaiian Japanese Vietnamese twist . It located in one of my favorite plaza on Ft . Apache and Sahara . SERVICE Fast and prompt . FOODThey have a unique variety of hotdogs that you wo not find anywhere else . Hotdogs are $6 - 7 but pretty small so I would recommend that you order their classic French fries or fried pickles on the side . Or two hotdogs . Euro Special Fries : My personal favorite ! I always get this when I visit Buldogis . It a regular French fries with pork belly cheese herb and garlic mayo . Fries are super crispy pork belly is seasoned well (although it is on the saltier side) and I love their creamy garlic mayo that drizzled on the fries . Huge portion as well . 5 5Buckeye Dog : Pork belly bacon corn relish cheddar and garlic mayo . Flavor was similar to Euro Fries but corn added some sweetness . 3 5Hawaiian Dog : Pork belly pineapple salsa g - onions and honey dijon mustard . It was like they added Mexican twist because of salsa but then added Hawaiian touch with pineapple . Overall too much going on for me . I prefer Buckeye over this one . 2 5CONCLUSIONI think the weiner they use in hotdogs are too salty to begin with . Then they add sauce and other things which makes it overwhelming . I will just stick with their Euro Fries from now on . ',\n",
       " 'Came in last night for my gfs 21st birthday . We had dinner at yard house and the plan was to have drinks and dessert here after . . . . We should have just stayed at YH . My Gf had a reservation all set up they even called to confirm with her a few days ago . When we all arrived they took us to a table and we heard one of the hostesses telling the server \"they did not even have a reservation\" it not like we needed one there were maybe two tables in there that were occupied and for good reason . . . I have dinned at the sugar factory on the strip before so I was very surprised at the horrible service we received at this location . The server never told us their name and the GM refused us his card . Our table was being completely ignored . I have been in the restraunt Industry for 13 years now and how we were being treated was completely uncalled for . I told the server a few times to bring out my gfs birthday dessert because another table got there but nothing . It never happened . It really put a damper on the night . There are so many places in Vegas especially to celebrate your 21st and we chose here . . . But we will never make that mistake again . I would be much happier paying full price for the other location or somewhere else entirely . ',\n",

       " 'Yelp Phoenix weekly last week had a list of Indian food . . . . When I saw it all of them listed looked very good including this place . I came here for early lunch the other day and really enjoyed my food here . They do get busy I am glad I arrived here around 11 :30am . Around the peak lunch hour they were completely full with some people in queue . I tried their iced chai tea . It has a nice bold tea flavor to it I really enjoyed it . I think I would have enjoyed more if it was hot . (It was still hot outside so I wanted iced tea but next time I will order hot tea) . I had tandori shrimp . Shrimp is served still in the shell but they prepared nicely to eat to peel off . Shrimp had a very nice tandori oven cooked flavor to it I enjoyed without any sauce as well as some of the sauce . My favorite was green one . They had four difference sauce each was good . Basmati rice was very good I enjoyed it with red sauce . (I do not know what they are but tasty . I asked for the name but I could not remember them) . For desert I tried Rasmalai Indian Cheesecake . I never had Rasmalai before . In fact I never heard of the name before . No pictures on the menu I decided to try anyway as I like cheesecake . Well it was nothing like cheesecake I thought . I was actually quite taken back when I first saw it served . It ended up being quite good very light perfect way to end Indian meal . I thought it helped me settle my tummy . I did not get to try any of their curry . I am looking forward to my next visit here and try their curry . ',\n",
       " 'They are known for their FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES . For $15 you get half of a chicken (drumstick wing thigh & breast) with 4 pieces of their popular Belgian Waffles . We decided to just get a side order of their chicken since we wanted to get other breakfast items . My friend and I decided to just get 1 drumstick each . - They charged us $7 for the 2 small drumsticks . - Holy crap it was near inedible as it was a complete salt bomb . - My friend commented that they have been really inconsistent with their fried chicken lately . 1st time : It was \"delicious the best fried chicken I have ever had . \" 2nd time he had it he said it was \"super bland\" so bland that he had to add salt to it himself . 3rd time yesterday : We damn near got high blood pressure . All you could taste was the salt . BREAKFAST CROISSANT ($7) : You cannot go wrong with eggs bacon and cheese . Very generous with the eggs and cheese it was basically spilling over . What I did not like was getting only 2 dinky slices of bacon . CRAB CAKE BENEDICT ($14) :Best dish of the day . The two crab cakes were meaty and tasted delicious the hash brown was crispy and lightly seasoned . It took over 25 mins for us to get our food . The kitchen just could not keep up you could see the servers all standing around by the window waiting to pick up their food . Our server was great in coming by frequently to update us on our orders so an extra star for him and his friendly professional attitude . Metro Diner is lucky to have him . ',\n",
       " 'OFFSITE DELISHTypically food at the LVCC is just terrible and it always the same boring food every day like pizza and burgers . So I was excited when I saw that Orgin India had a location inside the South Hall Las Vegas Convention Center . I discovered it during setup and could hardly wait for them to open up on Monday during the first day of the show . What I really loved was the different menu for all 4 days . No food kiosk here does that kind of variety or even changes their menu like that . There were two options to order . For $13 you could get one meat choice & one veggie choice with rice bread & sauces and for $16 you could add on two more items of meat & vegetable . On day one I ordered the Chicken Makhani Lamb Rogan Josh Tadka Dal and mixed vegetables . I must say that everything was delicious . My favorite was the lamb because it was so tender . It melted in my mouth . I really loved the sauce from the Chicken and I mixed it in with all of my white rice . The lentils in the Tadka Dal were really good too . After finishing my delicious lunch I only knew one thing that I could not wait to eat lunch here again tomorrow . On Day two I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo Chicken Karahi Dal Makhani and Gajjar Aloo . The spices were all amazing again . But I thought I was not going to get lunch here because the line went down the convention show floor . Obviously word had spread about the amazing food here . The secret was now out . I thought about getting out of line but decided to stay . I must admit the staff served everyone fast and I had my food in no time at all . I was so happy that it all worked out . Then on Day three I ordered the Chicken Curry Lamb Tikka Masala Sag Aloo and Chana Masala . Everything was amazing and such deep flavors . The potatoes and spinach in the Sag Aloo would not win any awards for looking beautiful but for taste that dish was a perfect 10 . Again the lamb was very tender like it had been all of the previous days I had eaten here . I was sad on Day Four because I could not make it over here to eat . I just hope that Orgin India continues making food at the LVCC for future trade shows . I also was lucky enough to get to meet the owner Raja . He was a very nice man and I also told him thanks for delivering delicious convention food . He told me that he had another food cart in the central hall . Wow he is a busy man . I also praised his choice of making different food every day . Raja suggested I try his mango yogurt drink called Mango Lassi . It was both refreshing and yummy in fact I could have had this drink for a full meal . On my walk back to my booth a few people asked me where I got the bright orange color drink . It was a real attention grabber . I must also talk about the yogurt on the side . It is so good with fresh cucumber carrot and spices . It is probably the best yogurt I have ever had . I was also amazed at the fresh herbs and spices they used to make the food . On two different days I found real cinnamon sticks inside the chicken dishes . There is nothing like fresh ingredients and it really shows in the taste . So if you are lucky enough to be attending a show at the LVCC I would highly recommend that you find either one of their locations . It not likely you find Indian food on the show floor of a convention center . I am happy to have found this place and to have met Raja . I wish him much success but I know he does not need it because he cares about his food and his customers . He is a very rich man in my book . I look forward to my next trade show in Vegas because I know where I m eating my next lunch . ',\n",
       " 'The overall quality of Mexican food in Henderson makes me want to cry . Most of the decent taquerias are at least several miles away on the east side of Vegas . And with the exception of the Lindo Michoacan chains in Henderson I have not found any food that is Mexican and noteworthy within the town limits . . . That is until Super Burrito opened recently . Driving down Eastern a few months ago I suddenly noticed the place were there . So I stopped in . And after the first visit I have kept stopping in and stopping in and stopping in and stopping in . . . Super Burrito is a top notch taqueria . They do a great job with the classic burritos - - carne asada and chicken . Well - prepared meat with delicious beans rice cheese sour cream and guacamole in a nice tortilla . Each time I order one I weep for my teenage self who suffered by repeatedly ordering Taco Bell not knowing what he was missing . If that was all that Super Burrito did I would give them a solid 3 . 5 stars but what pushes them into the four star range are the different sauces and flavors they cook into their meats . I have fallen in love with their green chile pork . Spicy and sweet and tender . It mixes perfectly with warm pinto beans and just makes me happy . I have also tried the coca - cola pork which was crispy and interesting but a little sweet for me . Each time I go in now I make sure to ask what meats they have in case they offer something new to wow me . Whether they come up with new offerings or not Henderson finally has a good taqueria . And that something to celebrate . I have no doubt that the town council will host a parade in Super Burrito honor right after they have their first taste . ',\n",
       " 'My wife and I ate at Fireside Grill this past week . We each ordered a ribeye steak salad french onion soup and a vodka cranberry . The horror show night started out with an incredibly inexperienced waitress that frankly had no business attending to patrons . Positive : The drinks were strong . Negatives :1 . The salad : Nothing to write home about . It seemed like the salad premixes that you buy at the grocery store that are never fresh . 2 . The soup : Mediocre nothing special . 3 . The ribeye : The steaks took the cake . My wife and I were expecting nice juicy rib eyes and they brought out some kind of strip steak that you would expect to see at a crappy diner with your eggs for breakfast . We ordered large 14oz rib eyes and were served steaks that could not even have weighed 4 ozs and each being no thicker than a nickel . It was so shocking that without giving it a second thought I told the waitress that there was something wrong and that we ordered rib eyes . Her answer was unreal \"This is all we have tonight . \"After complaining to the waitress and the manager I figured they would try to do something nice for us however they decided to add insult to injury and did absolutely nothing . The meal cost over $60 . I really hate writing a 1 star review but this place needs to be put out of its misery . The location is amazing looking out at the fountain and a good restaurant could really thrive here . ',\n",
       " 'A perfectly serviceable steakhouse ; nothing to recommend it over other steakhouses (both food - and ambiance - wise) . . . but if you are in the area and want steak this will do ! Reasonably reasonable prices ($35 for petite filet $20 for chicken) and bland - swanky decor . . . sort of like a Marie Callender of steakhouses for boring married couples or retirees on budgets who never go out to a steakhouse . If you rarely go out you will dig it . . . otherwise it pretty solidly Meh . In fact I would have given it two stars . . . except it gets an extra star for its blessed un - pretentiousness (no stupid all - caps name no deconstructed or fusion dishes and no douchebaggy club music playing) .

       " 'I drive by here everyday from work and finally made an opportunity to stop in after reading about it in an article from AZ Republic Dominic Armato awhile back . If you know anything about McDowell Rd it has great Mexican food up and down its long stretch of road . This place is a nice welcome addition to some of Arizona great food from across the border . It was started by a couple from Chihuahua Mexico who wanted to bring their flavors from home to the Valley . The outside does not look like much but do not let that fool you . This place serves up some top - notch street tacos . Food is ordered at the counter and you have a choice to dine inside or on their patio . They have a nice variety of slow simmering meats to choose from (including lengua (beef tongue) and tripe) that are packed into fresh corn tortillas . I went for the asada pastor and the signature taco chiwas (a combination of beef ham cheese Hatch chiles and jalapeños) . I seriously felt like I was chilling on some beach in Mexico putting down some buck street tacos . The meat is so tender and juicy . They have a nice condiment bar that you can get sides of salsa guac radishes and chilis to add to your meal . One thing I love about this place is the prices are very reasonable . Some of these new Americanized joints way overcharge for their tacos . You can get a full meal for under $10 here . I highly recommend getting their bean soup on the side - super good ! Also on their menu are burritos flour gorditas and breakfast (served 10am - noon) . ',\n",
       " 'A good friend of mine has this thing about coupons . She cannot let one go to waste . She jokes that her grave marker will read \"I got this headstone with a coupon\" . I think that is true . Anyway she received a coupon for Fleming Steak House from American Express . The coupon was for $40 off the total bill . The coupon could not be used for the early dining special offer . We arrived at 5 :30pm and the place was reasonably full . The crowd looked fairly young and we surmised these folks were here for the low priced special . The others diners may have been corporate dining on the boss dime . The dining room is large and brightly lit . Many of the tables are round booths inviting you to have a romantic dinner with your honey . Despite the small crowd and lighting the room was fairly quiet making you feel as if you were enjoying an intimate experience . When we were first seated a young man came by and asked if we wanted to start with the \"complimentary bread course\" . Since when has bread become a course? They wanted you to know how lucky you were to get free bread these days . We jumped on the offer knowing that this was the last complimentary thing to come our way . The bread was a crusty French bread and was really quite good . We each ordered a glass of wine . Our waitress was new . She was friendly and helpful . It was clear she was practicing a specific patter she was to use when describing options and menu items . I ordered a wedge salad with blue cheese dressing and a petite fillet . My friend had mashed potatoes with Parmesan and peppercorn and the bone - in rib eye . Both of our steaks were prepared perfectly medium - rare just as we had ordered . The meat was flavorful and tasted even better cold the next day . The serving size was reasonable . The mashed potatoes could have been shared with three people and the wedge salad was also a generous serving . The potatoes were \"ok\" . To put the costs in perspective I will tell you that a baked potato is $9 . 50 . Despite that fact we shared a slice of cheesecake which I thought was \"fine\" . I had coffee she had tea . I kicked myself for not asking for a second cup but truthfully I was too full to swallow another thing . In the middle of the meal the manager came by to see how things were going . His affect was so over - the - top we were speechless a cross between Guy Smiley and The Joker . Made us want to cringe . The whole experience seemed staged . . . bright lights pretty props and actors with a script . We had a good time (we generally have a good time no matter where we are) but it sure was clear who benefited from the coupon . . . Fleming . $150 really?',\n",

While I personally do not love hanging out in bars during the day Gold Spike was an okay compromise because they offer something other than drinking to pass the time . The place is somewhat of a complex with a bar and cafeteria - style restaurant inside (which features an entire wall of hot sauces . . . like 100 varieties . . . random cool gimmick ! ) If you need a little A C and a cheap drink Gold Spike is a surprisingly nice place to get the job done (though still lacking the sunlight that all Vegas bars shun) .

       " 'Having low expectations about this place it actually allowed this place to exceed expectations . Staying at LVH we got complementary coupons to try the buffet . Knowing we were going to pay for a big dinner we wanted to grab a small snack beforehand . Sure a buffet is not quite a snack but I was not expecting to eat much and since it was complementary the whole \"eating what I paid for\" concept that usually happens at most buffets did not apply here . But the food was actually quite tasty . They are currently having their FESTIVAL ITALIANO . I tried a few items . A couple of their pasta dishes some meat from their freshly sliced section . They even have a made to order pasta station if you want to be so bold as to create your own pasta dish . I was a little bummed we could not have any of the complementary beer and wine .

The Guacamole Steakburger which the fine people at S N S allowed me to customize with fried egg bacon and their most excellent Frisco *ahem 1 000 island ahem* sauce that ended up being used as a dipper for the order of ace shoestring fries is an achievement of fast food matching the Redhead in price and surpassing her in flavor . At S N S one can watch the globular chopped steak being pressed onto the flatiron grill and thus see for themselves how French - style is the dark horse way to prepare burgers . The edges blacken and crisp but the internals never lose their fatty tasteful moisture . The Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae is willing to take on all ice cream shoppe comers with its ideally baked discoids of dough . S N S prepares a better burger than many independent restaurants including such local disappointments as Redbeard . I am willing to risk imprisonment for stating that . S N S also offers a Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae that again trumped a non - chain this being the nightmarish failure sold by The Shiloh Grill . Furthermore the service was stellar something cannot say about every indie and that means YOU Shiloh Grill and Redbeard . When our server sensed that I was not mad about my Cherry Limeade (the syrup fell to the bottom) she immediately brought me another soft drink with a beautiful smile on her rosy lips .

Up until today I thought who better to bake a pizza pie than the pizza pie professionals . The GF came across some coupons for Papa Murphy and suggested we order . After a week of some what clean eating and listening to her telling me the pizza was good I thought I would give it a shot . We ordered up two pizzas about an hour before we were going to pick them up . The first pie was the Angus Steak & Roasted Garlic on a thin crust . The second was called \"Cowboy\" on an original crust . This was a more traditional pie consisting of red sauce pepperoni sausage mushrooms and olives . When we made our way to the shop we were greeted coming through the door . The remainder of the experience was friendly enough . The purchase of your take - n - bake was efficient enough . Out the door we went with two cellophane wrapped dough disks ; each one looked like a thawed out version of a frozen pizza I was sure to F - up in the very near future . When we got home the GF assumed the the role of an amateur pizza baker . It seemed to me the longest part of waiting for our meal was preheating the oven . When these gems were pulled from the oven they took on a very different appearance from other pizza delivery joints . These things looked fresh . . . . they radiated freshness . They smelled fresh . Best of all they tasted fresh . I proceeded to devour as many pieces I could . It was pure pizza joy . I quickly became pizza drunk on angus steak and pepperoni .

       " 'I have been on a baklava blitz as of late and that how I like it . I have been on the search far and wide to educate my palette on this delicacy . I am not one for desserts but I do have a soft spot for baklava when done right . Probably because of the honey rosewater or maybe it the delicious nuts ! Whatever it is when done right this stuff is heavenly every bite . This place is located in one of the many ghetto plazas on this stretch of town with it glaring lights it stands out ! And also that banner that simply claims \"Best baklava ! \" . Sure - whatever that means . As I walked in I am greeted by a young - ish gentleman in his chef attire with a gleaming smile . I see the articles on the wall ; proudly featured in Toronto Life newspapers . . . etc . This man proceeds to claim that unlike most they make their phyllo dough in house from scratch . The very thought of meticulously making each paper thin piece of phyllo hurts my head ! One bite and you will instantly taste that handmade dough . Flaky crispy light and airy as it whimsically melts in your mouth like fine rice paper . Then it an onslaught of nuttiness from an assortment of nuts like walnuts and pistachios . Finally rounded out by the sweetness from the syrup that it dipped in . Admittedly I love the dough but I think where they fall short here (of a five star) is with the slightly over roasted pistachios . The toastiness really overtakes a lot of the other flavours and is a bit overwhelming . Secondly the sweetness is rather dull and it too is a bit much . Of course this is a personal preference as I generally do not eat too much sweets . And disappointingly the honey did not pull through at all or much of the rosewater either . I applaud them for that great homemade dough but there is definitely room for improvements here . Still a decent Baklava though . ',\n",
       " 'Hostess : Good evening . Me : Good evening . Hostess : Do you have a reservation? Me : A reservation? Hostess : Yes a reservation . Me : You serve burgers here . I need a reservation to get a burger? WTF? This ai not the Rosewater Supper Club . This is the first time I have ever been asked if I had a reservation for a burger . Damn this place better have some great meat for this much attitude . Ok let get this out in the open right off the bat . The W Burger Bar all slick and tres mod is really just a jacked up burger version of Hooters a la beef . Now I see why all the previous guy reviewers like the wait staff . This is eye candy central here . It was a busy noisy Friday night when the girls who love to eat the meat Shari M . and myself met up with Kat D . to celebrate my Decemburger victory . So I figured since this was all about the burgers then I should be going for the Ferrari of burgers . . . . the big Kahuna . . . . the Kobe Burger . So much expectations on my part . Such a big let down . Our waitress who appeared to be one Red Bull over the line could do the speed dial routine on our order but seemed to take for ever to get a drink for anyone from the bar . When I first arrived I ordered the signature cocktail The W . which is actually really refreshing and not cloying at all . (Vodka Sloe Gin Lime and sparkling grapefruit juice) I order . . . . and 15 minutes later the waitress apologizes for not delivering yet because the bartender is totally swamped . The very same thing happens again to Shari . . . after a long wait for her libation it the same old song from the waitress . Apologies and tells us the barkeep is super busy . Yet the table behind us sits down and the manager comes running over with a tray of shooters . Hmmmmm . I order the Kobe burger and keep it simple because I want to taste the meat . Caramelized onions mustard relish pickles . I said it before and I will say it again do not eff up Momma burger . They completely missed the onions . While taking our order I suggest to Shari that we share some fries and Shari suggests we share Poutine instead . I say ok I will go for that . The waitress on auto pilot and speed dial for whatever reason brings us both poutine and the fries . Huh? As for my Kobe burger it was bland . Kobe meat does not need much to give it flavour . Initially on the first bite it was tasty but that waned quickly . This was definitely a knock off Kobe burger and for this they charge $18 . 95 . Steep price for sub standard meat . I have had Kobe before and it has a very distinct flavour but this burger was null and void of any flavour . Meanwhile the table behind us gets their pitchers of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer minutes after ordering and Shari still waits upon her cocktail . Service is whacked . Totally inconsistent . It even took Kat practically waving her credit card to get the bill . Sure makes me glad that I did not make a reservation at this place . We even had to ask for cutlery after she brought the food . Whatever . The evening was saved by the great company and a nightcap of coffee and pie at our favorite Pie shrine out in the Beaches . Thanks Tim for saving the night for us . We got more attention from Campbell the dog then we did from our waitress at W Burger Bar and we did not even have a reservation at the Pie Shack .

(Finally some fresh hot peppers which are actually hot ! )Oh yeah the service is also super friendly (both the man who took my order and the delivery guy) and the pizza arrived in 30 minutes flat . Ca not ask for anything else . . . other than some more Enzo pizza in the near future . ',\n",
       " 'JC Cuisine is a very new Chinese restaurant in the very old shopping center at the southeast corner of Maryland Parkway and Harmon Avenue across from UNLV . Always up for trying a new Chinese restaurant being that I was in the area JC Cuisine would be lunch . When I walked inside I showed the woman at the register the Yelp Check - in offer for a complimentary drink . Going off subject for a sentence I could create either a Yelp Talk thread or Yelp List on the greatest excuses that businesses give for incompliance with the Yelp Check - in offer . The excuse that the woman representing JC Cuisine gave is that the lunch special excludes the Check - in offer . I m thinking this is not the end of the world . The bottomless fountain Pepsi is $1 . 55 or a can is $1 . And most of all the Chinese lunch in special is one of the greatest deals around . JC Cuisine is a full - service Chinese restaurant that also offers take out . With that said the woman at the cashier walked me to my table . She was friendly . That is a reason that I passed over a star deduction for Check - in offer incompliance . Wearing a friendly attitude she led me to a table in the back of the house that was away from the window . This was on a June afternoon during a heat advisory . From this point on she was my waitress and I was the sole dining patron . Perusing the lunch special menu I observed that there is a $5 . 95 and $6 . 95 list . The later included shrimp based entrees . Proceeding this review there is a picture of this very lunch menu . I decided on the pepper steak with onions . At $5 . 95 it included a bowl of egg drop soup followed by the entrée with fried rice and soft chow mein noodles . Complimenting the waitress filled the glass of bottomless Pepsi . Now I will discuss the food . The egg drop soup tasted average . However there was a tasty touch of corn in the soup . A few minutes later the waitress delivered the meal . It was a unique presentation . This is the first time that I remember seeing Chinese food presented in a long dish that had three portions . One of the pictures that proceed this review shows the left portion holding fried rice the center holding pepper steak with onions and the right portion holding soft chow mein noodles . Working off the fried rice on the left portion the taste was agreeable . Close by it was more enjoyable working off the pepper steak with onions . Both of them were tasty and the right temperature . However when I worked off the soft chow mein noodles on the right side my taste buds were like \"This is filler and they have tasted better . \" Immediately I asked the waitress for hot sauce . She pointed to the bottle on the next table . I grabbed it then blanketed the soft chow mein noodles with it . This failed to blanket my opinion of the soft chow mein noodles . They were not warm . Considering that the fried rice and entrée were warm it was odd that the chow mein noodles were not . Are they supposed to be not hot? Fortunately two out of the three items on the plate were not bad . I agree with Meat Loaf philosophy that two out of three ai not bad . Then again it ai not great . The bill came out to $8 . 12 before the tip . After paying the bill I left with the opinion that JC Cuisine is an average Chinese restaurant . ',\n",

       " 'It has come to my attention that some of the information in my initial NEW Gum Do review may have been incorrect . First of all the shrimp do not come from Bangladesh as I had stated in my first review . The shrimp \" . . . they come from the store ! The store ! The store ! \" which may or may not be superior than that which I had stated . The shrimp stew may be excellent and in my haste to be both informative and erudite I may have jumped to the conclusion that shrimp from the Indian Ocean are not fresh in North Royalton for geographic reasons freshness expectations and the intractable nature of the time travel relationship . Also in the strictest sense of the word I did not in fact fornicate prior to consuming stew from NEW Gum Do and the person involved was not in actuality a cast member from Glee . As it relates to this matter my only explanation is that people employed at Home Days two dollar games of chance are trained to be deceitful and are particularly effective in the art of seduction . That the woman in question was a talented singer and had surprisingly life - like dentures only added to the ruse my inevitble deception and now my personal shame and humiliation . It only seemed fitting that in my hour of discovery I would turn to my five star friends at NEW Gum Do to seek solace and comfort in a tinfoil tray of stew and carrots carved into fun shapes . Only in places like NEW Gum Do can a person fallen as I may be be reborn . New Fortune : If reading this fortune you are cry you must . Sigh . ',\n",
       " 'I found Lou Diner by accident . I was in their parking lot to answer an email starving and noticed their sign . I pulled up my Yelp app read a few of my Yelp friend reviews and made up my mind that I m having eggs for lunch . I walked in and it was not busy at all . I sat myself and was a little concerned that the service would take a while since no one noticed me walking in . Within 10 minutes one of the waitresses attended to me and gave me a menu . Their menu is mainly a traditional American breakfast (i . e . omelets sandwiches burgers soups etc . ) . I kept my meal simple and had their 3 egg cheese omelet 4 slices of bacon well done extra crispy hash browns and some toast . This breakfast combo was very affordable at only $8 . I also added a cup of their homemade chili which ended up being the highlight of my entire meal . The chili has a bit of a kick hearty and had enough meat to satisfy my protein needs . A cup of their chili is good enough to make me a repeat customer . If I had one gripe it the cheese in their omelets . I prefer shredded cheese in my omelets not sliced cheese . Lou Diner was able to add shredded cheese to my chili . Why could not they do this for their omelets? In the future I will request it . It never hurts to ask right?This diner has been around a very long time . It nice to see businesses from the 60 still thriving . It also obvious that Lou has its share of regulars . The service was great and the price per dish is better than most . I m sure that I will be returning soon especially if I m craving their chili . ',\n",

       " 'The food is usually very tasty and vegetarian friendly . The spinach pasta salad is great and is such a large serving its more than enough for two people . The Veggie burger is delicious and I usually order it with both sauces on the side . It comes with roasted red pepper on it which gives it a meaty taste almost . I definitely recommend the Veggie burger for not only vegetarians but for meat eaters also . I advise against the Caribbean salad - - When I ordered it the fruit tasted funky and there were like 2 strawberries on top of a heaping large platter of fruit . My friend ordered it a second time and the fruit tasted spoiled . This is the only dish I have tried here that I did not enjoy . The only reason I give this place 3 stars rather than 5 is due to the service . . . which SUCKS ! The waitresses and waiters take forever to come to your table and take your orders . Last time I ate there my friends and I wanted salads and people that came in AFTER us were served their food before we could even ORDER . Every time i eat at this place I kick myself for even tipping the worst waitresses I have EVER encountered . I have had better service at crap diners like the Waffle House . I have been to this location countless times because it around the corner from my house and there are not many vegetarian places in Gilbert but I started ordering take - out orders because the service is so terrible . Even the cashier is rude and ignores people when they are standing there asking for their order information ! Ok I feel better now that I have ranted about their terrible service . ',\n",

I would also like to add in my defense that it was just across the street - Which should have made for a quick lunch . As soon as you step inside the dimly lit entry you get the connection to New Orleans and the French Quarter by the infinite amount of items plastered around the walls . They will come in handy when you are trying to pass the \"infinite\" amount of time it takes to get your order taken . Of the four times I have walked through their doors our table left once because of a 20 minute wait with no service and complimentary desserts were served another time because of 45 minutes with no food . Fool me once shame on you . Fool me four times shame - shame on me . If you are dragged to this place get the chicken pot pie .

So it was nice to have a pleasant dining experience after all that ! Santa Barbara is a nice casual - but - trendy place . Lots of light woods religious iconography candlelight . The waitress was very nice . I tried speaking French she spoke French back I stared at her wide - eyed as I realized I was in way over my head and she promptly and pleasantly switched to English . I could have hugged her . Menu is very simple and bilingual . Of import : although this place is primarily vegetarian there are a few animal dishes on the menu . Pork chops and a couple fish dishes . This is relevant . Read on . I permitted myself an alcoholic drink bcs I deserved it . Gin with citrus and earl grey tea . It tasted delicious but was small for the price (in my opinion ; I do not drink much so I m not a good judge ! ) and I could not really taste the tea . Joe got the gnocchi which he raved about . I tried some and it was absolutely delicious . My entree came with quinoa which was mixed with beets and oranges . I had never had quinoa like this and I have to say it was delicious . I am definitely stealing the idea to make at home ! The rest of my entree was fish . Because I am an absolute moron and accidentally ordered fish . I cannot tell you how the server would have reacted if I sent it back bcs I was too humiliated to do so . So I chopped it into little pieces casually hid it in my napkin and then threw it out later . I think one of the other waiters saw me because he came by and was like \"Ca va?\" Then he said some other stuff which may have been \"Because I see that you are wrapping your food in your napkin like a maniac . \" but I did not understand it so I just said \"Oui ! ! ! ! ! ! Ca va bien ! ! ! ! ! Merci merci merci ! \" over and over until he must have concluded that I was definitely a maniac and left . This is how the socially awkward deal with problems people ! Despite my idiocy I will repeat : the gnocci and quinoa were both fantastic . And honestly even when I ate meat I did not like fish but this fish smelled and looked incredible . If I were still a meat eater I would have tried it . Promise . They take cards but ours did not work so we had to get cash across the street at a gas station . By then I think the waitress was sick of us bcs she seemed to get a little snippy . But I promise we were doing our absolute best as strangers in a strange land !

       " 'There clearly a reason why Topgolf is always so crowded even though there three levels of side - by - side bays . Let me start by saying that I am by no means a decent golfer . . . or even a golfer at all : in fact I do not think I have ever actually been golfing (aside from mini - golf) . That being said I absolutely love Topgolf . Every time I m in town I make it a point to come here because the driving range is a blast the food and drinks are delicious and everyone has a great time no matter who I go with . The obvious place to start is the driving range . The way it set up is a regular driving range but with targets that you try to hit with golf balls that have sensors in them . There are different \"games\" you can play based on your skill level ranging from just trying to hit any target to getting more points for hitting farther away targets to having to hit specific targets . Topgolf supplies all the clubs and balls that you will need for any of these and that all included in the price of the bay (but I only use the driver because I m going for distance you feel me?) ! I have seen people bring their own clubs in as well so feel free to do that if you have a set but I m not that legit . The food and drinks at Topgolf are also great and they have a pretty big selection on the menu . I never eat a full meal here but I have had a number of the appetizers and they have all been delicious ! You can also order drinks in a light up golf bag - shaped souvenir cup that you get to keep so that a great deal . The waiters who come to your bay will make sure you are set on food and drinks during your whole visit ! Whether you are a pro - golfer or this is your first time at a driving range Topgolf is the perfect place to have a good time perfecting your skills . ',\n",

According to an October 9 article in the Record Courier \"We are starting off with a small menu just to get out of the gate \" Longhitano said adding that current menu items also include burgers salads and \"great Italian food . \" Indeed a laminated single - page menu was on each table with maybe 20 menu items including appetizers sandwiches salads soups and entrees . There were no pictures of their food . When I arrived at 3 :30 pm there was only one table occupied by two older gentlemen . The waitress who sort of greeted me told me to have a seat anywhere . When she approached my table I had my back to her and she started talking to me before she ever arrived at my table . I had to ask her if she was talking to me . When she returned to my table to take my order again she started talking before she even got to my table . Her enthusiasm was underwhelming . When she asked to take my order she did not volunteer any information . I asked her to describe the lobster ravioli and she held up her fingers to show the size of the ravioli and said it had lobster meat in it (well duh) and their alfredo sauce . I asked her if they made it themselves and she said no . I asked her if it came with anything and she said a side salad . I decided to try it and I think it was the most expensive entree at $15 . When the salad arrived it was just unwashed (I think) romaine lettuce with one cucumber slice one tomato wedge with a big yellow stem portion in it and some cheddar cheese on top . The unremarkable dressing was on the side in a plastic condiment cup . A gentleman brought the ravioli to my table . I m guessing he may have been the owner and he looked a little dirty and unkempt . I tried the first ravioli and it was barely warm . I tried the second and it also was barely warm so I set the plate aside to wait for my waitress to return . I eventually gave up on that and asked a second waitress to get her . Before she asked me what was wrong she said \"cold\"? That tells you something does not it? They microwaved the plate and the first bite was hot but that was it . I did not finish the meal .

I have been to Topgolf a couple of times now and enjoyed myself but I just cannot see the value in paying $45 hour for this activity especially when you add in overpriced food and drinks . And you also need to pay $5 per person to \"sign up\" on your initial visit to Topgolf . The machines are slow to switch between players and even slower at providing you with your next golf ball to hit . . . so even if you are hitting balls non - stop (which no one would or could do) you still would not be able to hit more than maybe 120 balls in an hour . And most groups are going to waste additional time eating talking drinking and just not focusing on hitting balls as fast as possible . When your time is up then you are asked to move out of that area within minutes regardless of whether you still are finishing up your food and drink . Mind you this last visit happened to be on a Tuesday and we experienced this again . With the prices of the food and drink it a fairly expensive \"meal\" where you get to hit a few golf balls .

A greater meet us and nervously tried to explain the concept . He focused on the build a bundle option probably because its the closest to what Sweet Tomatoes used to be . We both ordered the bundle however we made the mistake of ordering before we saw the salad bar (which is half of what the available selections used to be or at least it seems like it) . I made my salad but was disappointe to see no egg no bacos no parmission cheese and no blue cheese crumbles . I made my salad the best I could but knew at that point I might have made a mistake . \"Can I have your card please sir?\" Chi - Ching . I decided to also order the chicken ginger and garlic skewers thinking maybe that would makeup for the lack of ingredients in my salad . I poured my soup and get a table . Another card swipe Chi - ChingWent to get a coke card sir ! Another Chi - Ching . At this point I felt like I was being Nickle - n - dimed . The soup was disappointing because the bundle did not offer the chili and the only option I remotely liked was the chicken noodle so not wanting to complain I tried it . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Food run - down : - Salad was boring my partner could not use her dressing because it \"taste funny\" and I gave up on mine after two bites because the only items I liked that they offered were corn and carrots . . . got bored of that real quick . - Chicken noodle soup was bland like siping dishwater with lots of veggies in it . . . - No bread was offered to us however we noticed it did not look too great when we walked by it so we skipped it . - The chicken skewers looked like the chicken was run over toned up by the tires of a card grilled and skewed . They had no ginger taste and definitely no garlic taste . . . I ate two bites and put the rest down . - Dessert was a chocolate yogurt (no idea if it was low fat or not) and the dessert bar had no topping at all . . . Gone . What the point of having that dessert machine if there nothing to put on you lump of poo - like chocolate . Customer Service - Greater that meet us upon arriving was young nervous and had a very hard time explaining the menu and card system . . . Tough we figured it out on our own - Gentlemen at the skewer station was nice but after I ordered he said it would be a few minutes and he would \"wonder around and find us\" . . . No numbers or card for the table . . . Not very professional - Waitress at table was also nice however when I said I did not like any of it and she took my meal away she did not mention it to a manager no supervisor came to ask us about our meal . . . nothing . - The cashier was also nice but when we asked how was everything I gave him this same rundown of complaints . . . His response everytime I mentioned something negative was so sorry for that . . . Neither him or the gal standing next to him bothered to offer the meal for free or get a supervisor . Just rang us up . . . $25 . . . For two people that barely touched their food and told staff we were unhappy . Decor and seating : - I like the color schemes and overall newness and updating of the location . However we noticed these annoying light bulbs at each table where you can see the filament in each bulb just singing its impression on your eyes so that everywhere else you look you get that ghost affect from seeing something too bright of too long . . . Who thought of this and did they actually eat a meal next to these light bulbs?Concept Field Kitchen - Epic Fail . Loyal sweet tomatoes fans not going back .

       " 'I stopped in my tracks staring at the large sign in front of me shining like a giant beacon beckoning me to come closer . I could not believe it . Is it real? Do my eyes deceive me? IS THAT BOBA? In North Carolina??? Without a second to waste I dragged my coworker like a rag doll inside the brightly lit parlor that was decorated with velvet couches plushy chairs twinkling lights and large decorative lamps hanging from above . With contemporary music blasting through the sound system it was almost as if I was back in the Bay Area on a typical boba run with my darling hubby . The black menu showcased various fruit teas bubble teas (smoothies) milk teas and hot drinks . My eyes however instantly locked on the milk tea section spotting my favorite green milk tea . I eagerly ordered that with grass jelly while my coworker got a strawberry bubble tea with pearls . But my eagerness faltered just a bit when I caught a glance of my boba that was . . . green?I do not remember green milk tea being green (ironic now that I think about it) . I hesitantly popped the lid and took a small sip before the familiar taste of matcha hit my tongue . While I understand why this would be called green milk tea I cannot say that I did not feel somewhat tricked . . . It was not the drink I was expecting at all . That not to say I m not a fan of matcha . I most certainly do like the flavor but Tea Fusion Cafe made the drink a bit too powdery . I did not like the chalky aftertaste hanging around on my tongue . However I did like how they used crushed ice and that the grass jelly was silky even though the pieces all floated to the top . I was alarmed that in terms of prices Tea Fusion Cafe closely matched those in the Bay Area . I thought California was always going to be more expensive when compared to North Carolina but clearly that is not always the case . Perhaps the lack of demand raises the price?When it comes to boba though I do not think there are a lot of states that can compete with the plethora of choices in California but to see that Charlotte had at least one was a pleasant surprise .

       " 'Unbelievable BBQ . Family run and the best in the southwest . The owner does the cooking and he takes full pride with his passion and does not slack when making this meat . Top notch food . I m sure you have read it before so I will say it again . The wait time to get food is a good hour . Get there early because they run out of the good stuff early and close by 4pm . Lastly drive a small vehicle . The parking lot is small and is tough to park a larger rig . Go eat here and savor every moment of it . The fatty brisket and the sausage are my favorites . ',\n",
       " 'This place is Fn amazing . The boy took me here for my birthday dinner and literally I cannot think of any other place I would have rather been at . We went late 9pm rez It was an amazing evening so we sat outside near the fireplace . You seriously have to sit outside it almost like you are in another state on vacation with how secluded it is . Each table gets its own heat lamp too by the way . We started with a bottle of Champagne and the sommelier there was so cool . Loaded with suggestions and just a really friendly dude . We also started with the Mussels and Foie Gras - both equally amazing . The mussels were delicious . . I LOVE mussels and ever since I left Boston I have not had any good ones . . these were awesome . I wanted more . The Foie Gras was obviously delicious . . Prepared to perfection and it was gone in less than 30 seconds . For our entrees I got the lamb and B got the Beef Tenderloin . For our sides we got the Mac n Cheese & Grilled Asparagus . I m not even kidding when I say that we did not leave ONE bite on our plates . We devoured everything and all of it was perfect . Especially the bottle of wine we split with it . To wrap up the meal we got the crème brulee to share and as my photo shows they personalized it for my special day . That along with 2 glasses of port and we were good to go . . Staff do not mess around they are at your beck and call from the moment you pull up to valet . I will say this place is not cheap and seemingly only appropriate for special occasions however I will absolutely go back again and again and again birthday or not . Seriously one of the most delicious dinners ive ever had period . ',\n",
       " 'This place is not that easy to find but I m glad I hung in there and found it because I really liked it . Stopped in for lunch last week to try something new . When I walked in I was immediately greeted . The man behind the counter asked if I had been in before and when I said no gave me several recommendations . He also told me the make all their mayos and sauces there . A big plus in my book . I decided to try the Vermonter with a side of pasta salad . The sandwich was plenty big and the bread was fresh (always important) . The turkey and ham were tasty and the sliced apple was a nice touch . It was a little light on the cranberry mayo though . The couple bites I had where I could taste it I thought it was really good - would have loved more ! The pasta salad hada good flavor but the noodles were either undercooked or dried out . Kinda seemed dried out . They were a little hard for pasta salad IMO . They have a few tables inside but more tables outside which was great since the weather was nice . Could get a little crowded inside in the summer . Overall I really liked this place and now that I know how to find it I would go back . ',\n",

Awesome . The bad :The service fucking sucks . Let me be clear : it does not just suck it FUCKING SUCKS . It was slow lazy and they got an order completely wrong . The meal came out slowly which was not that horrible but noticeable . Still I thought the restaurant deserved a solid four stars . But as the meal was ending my dining companion ordered potato skins to - go to bring to his wife . As she was pregnant and had an aversion to certain foods he very clearly and explicitly ordered the potato skins without onions or bacon . Well I will bet you can guess what kind of merry - go - fucking - fuck - coaster came next right? It took a half an hour after we were done eating (and twenty minutes after we would paid for the damn things) for the potato skins to come out . And when they did guess fucking what? Onions and bacon up on that bitch . Needless to say my friend and I were livid . We got the manager and his saving grace (and the only reason why this restaurant gets two stars) is he quickly fixed it . Skins were back out sans onions and bacon and the amount we paid for them was quickly refunded . Good to know there one competent person in this restaurant . I guess maybe some day I can be convinced to go back but those idiot fucking servers had better tremble if they see my face in that restaurant again .

The food here even though it is considered fast food is amazing . I am waiting for my fat burger now and enjoying a little people watching here in the lobby of the LV strip . This location is convenient to so many restaurants in this immediate area . It is fairly busy too . The lobby is not crowded most seem to order and then enjoy their burgers on the go or at the bar . Their is a shady area for guests to enjoy their food outside . It needs a better way to keep it cool but some guests might enjoy the umbrella shade even on our 100 plus degree summer days . The cashier was pleasant and friendly and took my order with no issues . While waiting for my food the only issue that came up was the fact that they do not have ice cold air conditioning for the guests . The skinny burger that I ordered hit the spot too . Plus it was less calories than the larger burger too ! ',\n",

       " 'Being 72 I felt my parents tremble a bit when I said I was taking them to the \"farm\" . Growing up in the midwest it wasnt rare to hear \"somebody bought the farm\" . This did not mean an uncle decided to purchase a ranch but rather met his maker is now six feet under or my favorite \"he in a better place now . \" That said my folks were delighted at our Farm experience . It always a challenge getting dad a plain sandwich in any restaurant but they were very accommodating . Mom and I both enjoyed our turkey sandwiches and the ice tea is extra good . Maybe it brewed in the sun . That would be very farm - like no? Now I get the whole theme here with the picnic tables and all . Just not a big fan of it myself . That and walking on grass . Ewww ! But it called the Farm and not the City so no points docked for that . Really a unique Phoenix experience with a gift shop walking trails and the smell of dirt .

By way of New York City I am conditioned for a night of live comedy to be expensive with their two drink minimum and no appetizers under $15 and a line to get in the place . This place was a refreshing change . Good comedy and even better food for a fraction of what you would expect to pay . The single issue I had is that we could not hear the comic at one point over the crowd . Due to that we missed a good portion of the show . The bathrooms are clean the staff is friendly and attentive . The crowd is diverse and pleasant . The music is fun and again . . . Did I mention the food? Pub grub it is NOT . So I will mention it here again because I had the very best Turkey Burger of my life last night . I can hear it calling to me now .

Where are you from?\" They also have family pictures all over the wall going back to when they first opened . Nice !

I dig it . But my favorite Mediterranean dish will always be chicken shwarma . The version here is heavily seasoned (a good thing ! ) available in a plate or wrap .

       " 'On the Saturday of my bachelorette party my girlfriends treated me to dinner at Sushi Samba . It was a fabulous memorable meal where we ate well and celebrated in style . We were staying at The Palazzo and Sushi Samba was the perfect venue for the occasion . It was convenient to get to in heels and the atmosphere was festive edging on clubby without being obnoxious . We had a big comfortable table and service was excellent . I wish we would gotten the name of our waiter - he did a great job attending to our every need and he guided us through the whole dining experience with expertise . (For management - he was a tall guy who served a party of nine on 6 29 . You know your only bachelorette party of the month?)We ordered cocktails which were pretty good . I had a Blame it on Rio a caipirinha variation with cachaça agave syrup fresh lime juice cucumber and jalapeño . It was both cool and spicy and it went down really easy . The classic caipirinha was also great with just the cachaça lime and sugar . I also tried some of the Chu - Cumber a shochu drink with Hendricks gin elderflower liqueur and muddled cucumber - very refreshing . At some point we got a complimentary cocktail tree a beautiful iron tree bearing shot - sized wine glasses on every branch . They held some frothy sweet version of a screwdriver that was great for the occasion . Dinner was delicious . We had the option of ordering a la carte or omakase and we decided to keep things simple . We specified a price point and listed dietary restrictions and the food just started coming . It was all served family style and everything was well portioned for our big group . We left full but not overstuffed - a plus since it had taken a team to stuff me into my white dress for the night . The cuisine was fun a creative unforced fusion of Japanese and Peruvian styles . First we had a trio of vegetable otsumami all served together in a lovely green array . There was the staple edamame with sea salt and lime and green bean tempura served with a rich black truffle aioli . My favorite of the three though was the handful of shishito peppers . These were grilled blistering black polished with sea salt and lemon . They were pretty irresistible . Next we got a tray of Japanese A5 wagyu beef gyoza . These were great thin - skinned and stuffed with luscious hunks of beef rather than the usual mince . They came with kabocha pumpkin purée a sweet soy drizzle and a su - shoyu dipping sauce . The best thing I ate all night though was a crispy taquito overflowing with yelllowtail avocado and roasted corn miso . The shell was thin and crunchy and the fresh tender fish was just right with that avocado miso and some thinly sliced vegetables . The taquitos were served with spicy aji panca sauce and fresh lime - that piquant frothy sauce was just the icing on a beautiful fusion taco cake . After the smaller plates were done we moved on to big platters of sushi and sashimi . I do not remember everything we got as there were at least six or seven rolls and even more kinds of sashimi . The rolls were great a nice mix of California standards - you know the mix and match of eel yellowtail tuna etc . with avocado cucumber and dots of mayo - and more Samba - specific stuff with the stray crab leg and lobster claw . I particularly liked the Samba Strip with Maine lobster tempura mango tomato chive soy paper and a coating of crispy rice . It was unusual and flavorful served with a peanut curry . The rest of the platter came with a sweet thick soy sauce and a bit of mayo . The sashimi was more traditional served on a bed of ice . It was hard to share as there was only one of each kind but the slivers I had were great . The most filling part of the meal was the churrasco course . We got two hefty platters of the Rio Grande with three meats grilled hanger steak ribeye and chorizo . These were great juicy and tender and full of that hearty grilled meat flavor . They came with a trio of dipping sauces - malagueta pepper oil chimichurri and a third that is infuriatingly absent from the menu . We also had some sides of rice beans collard greens and a medley of roasted vegetables - giant corn kernels toothsome brussels sprouts carrots celery pearl onions and more . We also got miso - marinated Chilean sea bass a la carte with roasted organic vegetables and oshinko . This was a winner - the fish was moist flakey and shot through with miso flavor . We were full by dessert but loved the complimentary chocolate mousse served with a sparkler and a congratulatory message . The lush mousse came topped with crunchy chocolate pearls whipped cream and a little bit of candle - stuck banana . We each got a sweet bite to end our wonderful dinner . In conclusion my friends are the best - thank you girls for this weekend and for this fun delicious meal . Sushi Samba was an A + choice worthy of a night I wo not soon forget . ',\n",
       " 'Imagine two college roommates one an all - american kid raised on classic fast food fare the other a Korean foreign exchange student with an overprotective mom preparing meals weekly from home and then picture some pothead next door raiding their refrigerator one night and throwing their leftovers together in one massive pile for a meal of his own . That may have been my first impression upon glancing at the menu but after finishing my first meal here I am convinced this is the work of some evil mad culinary genius . Went and checked out this place over lunch with a friend and decided to sample their two most popular items : the #1 (Beef Buldogi hotdog) and the Angry Kimchi FriesThe beef bulgogi dog is a 100% premium beef dog covered with an avalanche of Asian cole slaw grilled onions generous strips of beef bulgogi (marinated beef with Korean seasonings finished off with a dusting of sesame seeds and a light drizzle of house mayo . The first bite of any hot dog usually begins with a naked end devoid of bread or toppings and one can tell that the Buldogi dog has been grilled to that perfect smokey char with a nice firm \"snap\" of the casing that explodes with mouthwatering flavor . The contrast in textures and flavors from the tender bulgogi crispy slaw smokey onions creamy mayo and toasted sesame seeds surprisingly round out one another in harmonious balance . The angry kimchi fries was a whole other beast . Wheras the oxtail chili cheese fries at Bachi Burger look better than they taste the Angry fries here taste better than they look . Start with a bed of sweet potato fries add a layer of pork bulgogi throw in some cooked kimchi and melted cheese with diced green onion and jalapeno and then finishing the whole concoction with a sunny side egg I found myself unable to stop with each progressive bite since something so wrong apparently seemed so right ! There a stroke of brilliance with the choice of sweet potato for the starch since the natural sugar cuts through all the spicy and savory components and the richness from the cheese and runny egg yolk cleverly binds all the distinct bold flavors together (pro - tip : break the yolk immediately upon being served otherwise the heat from the other ingredients will continue to cook the egg)If I had one minor critique it would be the lack of beer and the ambience inside is a bit drab since I think the food has heavy flavors that go well with beer in the company of friends with a sporting event in the background since I would totally attend any stadium or ballpark which served these items . It looks like they may have attempted to expand previously but the other location appears closed on yelp but hopefully their following will grow to be successful on a repeat attempt in the future .

I know mole is a style thing more than an absolute (the \"right\" amount of chocolate . . . the right \"umami\" etc . so when I say that Los Sombrero mole is kind of \"mediocre\" and the mole at Frank and Lupe (which used to be pretty decent) would now be better if they just poured a can of unsweetened Hershey syrup over chicken tartare . . . you know I mean those minor critiques with love :)I played squash on Saturday . . .

Uncle Buck :) chatted with Jose one of the owners when we arrived and I got a chance to say \"hello\" too . I got a little bit of the history of the place . . . used to be owned by the parents used to be smaller and more intimate (something I always like in a taco shop . . . PTV is not small any longer) . We got chips and salsa . . . pretty good chips and better salsas although the 2 kinds of salsa came in squeeze bottles (I am really more of a \"dunker\" than \"squeezer\" when it comes to salsa . . . it was fine . . . you just have to make a little volcano of both kinds of salsa and use 2 chips to push things around . . . but I do not really like to have to work the chip thing that hard :)The enchiladas came and heavens to murgatroid they were tasty ! ! ! Pronounced chocolate flavor not too salty with the just the right amount of bitterness from the unsweetened Mexican chocolate :) The chocolate blended with the grilled chicken flavor and the sweetness of the corn tortillas to produce an outstanding enchilada . I also ordered the Olla beans . . . highly recommended ! You can get refries anywhere and I doubt that PTV are significantly (or any) better than others . But they put a bunch of jalapeno in the pot to make these pot beans a cut above the rest :)They say that chocolate accesses the same brain chemistry that sex does and I think that might have been the case with my enchilada :)But I was there with Wes and his family . . . they were kind enough to invite me along and show me where to get good mole . . . a full on foodgasm would have just been wrong . . . even for me :)',\n",

Handmade ravioli stuffed and fried with a side of marinara sauce to dip them in . There was definitely some kick to it as they were stuffed with cheese and jalapenos . It was a very satisfying meal and I m giving it three stars . The portions were big the prices were reasonable (looking at the website since he brought it to my place) and everything was full of flavor .

       " 'I stopped by here to order some lunch to - go . There was a nice lady who greeted me as I walked inside . She gave me plenty of time to look over the menu and decide what I wanted to order . I have to say I was a little nervous at first because it looked like the inside good use a deep cleaning all over but after seeing all the buzz on yelp I decided to give it a try . . . . . . Then seeing what Loren F . mentioned about the cleanliness in her review after I had eaten there kind of made me think about not going back even if I did like some of my food because I noticed some of the same cleanliness issues . Tacos Combo ($8 . 50) - 3 tacos rice and beans with cheese are in this combo . You can choose from different meats it does not all have to be the same kind of taco so I went with 3 different tacos . The carnitas chicken and pastor were all tasty meats . I actually ended up just eating the filling with a fork and it tasted good . I was not sure what \"Chicago Style\" tacos were but according to Stefany V . review it apparently means that they serve yellow corn tortillas that are fried . I personally found them to taste hard and stale which is why I ate the inside salad style with a fork . I also did not get the tomato slices they put on the tacos when chopped tomatoes just make more sense . The rice had great flavor while the beans had crunchy bits yuck . Lots of hit and miss here . Windy City Fries ($5 . 99 for small size) - The fries come topped with your choice of meat and pico sour cream cheese and guacamole . I asked for no meat and extra beans instead and they made it that way with no problem . The problem I ended up having was the beans had crunchy bits just like the beans with my taco combo no bueno . The fries actually held everything up well and did not get soggy which is a plus and the pico and guac were pretty good but those crunchy beans ruined it . ',\n",
       " 'I met two friends from New York for dinner at Hawthorn and it was a good experience . I was not sure what to expect when I read that this was the old Ceres restaurant remodeled . Ceres was a place we liked to bring family and friends when they visited because of the lovely room and the fantastic patio . The makeover does not disappoint except the partitions take away the view of the waterfalls in the landscaping unless you get a table by one of the windows . We were seated promptly and brought water and iced tea . Before we ordered a server arrived with two blocks of bread - - one multi - grain and one plain - - and there was a knife for cutting the squares out . You could pull it apart also . Two of us ordered the sweet potato gnocchi with lobster and one got the petit filet . The gnocchi lobster duo with the spaghetti squash was a creative dish and shellfish butter helped bring the items together . They were not skimpy with the lobster . My friend filet was cooked properly and he said it was good . He had a baked potato but the two of us with the gnocchi skipped a side dish saving room for dessert . For dessert I had the citrus lemon meringue tart with raspberry coulis and raspberry white chocolate ice cream . My friend ordered the caramel mascarpone cheesecake that she shared with her husband . We both were very pleased with our desserts . The lemon meringue tart was excellent . Service was very good . Iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass and we were checked on during dinner to make sure all was going well . It was a pleasant time having good food with good friends . I need to return and try some other things on the menu and maybe eat on the patio when it cooler . ',\n",

I checked two pizza parlors at random who have owners without Chrissy Bianco ego and for an 18\" pizza to add sausage they charge $1 . 75 . A dollar seventy five ! But not Bianco ! FIVE DOLLARS ! Listen I have made money had money lost money ; it my opinion that $5 for sausage on a 10 - 12\" pizza is pure narcissism . It just silly .

Smaller than their regular yeast - raised doughnuts the cake doughnuts are ridiculously moist dense fluffy and has a good amount of sweetness . Not to be outshine their raised doughnuts are just as good even lighter in texture and are gigantic . It hard to say which is better but they are both amazing . They sell a dozen doughnut holes for $0 . 99 to cater to the students around the area which I find spectacular . It a small mom and pop place and from what I hear they recently changed owners . It a clean shop that also sells beverages like smoothies and boba . Stop in and give Golden Donuts a try ! ',\n",
       " 'Mahalo Nicole for finding this place and I have to say this place is a gem ! I have to admit it was quite a drive from Henderson to get here but I was not disappointed at all . Kauai Cafe is tucked away next to a gas station at the Smith food and drug shopping center on Tropicana and Hualapai and has one of the cleanest open kitchen I ever seen in Las Vegas . I made a big mistake of coming here after the gym because I was damn hungry and went off ordering a bunch of stuff . One of the best things about Yelp is how our members will post menu of most establishments and what caught my eye the most was their Kauai friend chicken . Do not get me wrong I almost change my mind a few time because of the other mixed plates specials but I m glad I did not . From what I notice Kauai Cafe will let you make a choice between white rice fried rice or fried noodles at no extra cost . I ended up with the fried rice and it was loaded with spam char sui peas carrots and green onions and of course it was made to order . The rice was a little too sticky but hey . . . we are from Hawaii and it was okay . The mac salad was good and ate of all of it but the Kauai fried chicken was a HOME RUN ! Think of a Huihui brine Chicken with a Manapua man fried chicken crust . It was juicy and had a slight huihui chicken sweetness to the meat but how the Heineken beer was infused into this recipe was ingenious . I have to rate this chicken a 5 star winner and I would drive 30 miles one way just to eat this again . I also ordered the Portuguese bean soup ( $2 . 50) and it was better than Island Flavor it was okay but I would not order it again . What dropped my rating down from a five to a four was the Madasada . Do not get me wrong the bugga was good and had the perfect crust (which is nearly the same as Leonard in Honolulu) which had a slight crunch to it and lightness for most of the madasada but the very middle was still cold . I believe they keep the madasada dough in the cold storage and it was not completely thawed out but I still enjoyed it and for some reason the Madasada was still good and moist the next day . Yes if they fix this . . . . watch out Island Sushi there could be someone in Las Vegas who might top you folks on Hawaii favorite doughnut . Again it a very easy fix for them to do and my rating will shoot to a high five if get let it sit for a little while . I m a fan of this place and will make another drive to check them out again .

       " 'You guys like Mexican? You like Chinese food? Do you like burritos that communicate with you telepathically? Well do I have a Asian fusion burrito place for you . This place . Had the fish burrito last time I was here and it was great . Did not talk or have any emotions but still tasted real good . This time I ordered the jerk chicken special burrito with chow mien noodles and things got interesting . As I was eating it the burrito started to speak to me inside my mind . Saying things like \"good eh?\" and \"yeah bud . \" It was like eating my best friend who was also a hockey coach . Weird thing is I was not freaked out . Felt so normal . He said his name was Jeremy and that he would see my on the other side (poo out my butt) and boy he was NOT wrong . HahaGreat burritos . Ask for the talking one . Tell em Jeremy sent you . ',\n",
       " 'I will cut to the chase on this - stay clear of this disaster of a restaurant . I went out to with some friends last night and this place screwed up in every possible way . It took about a half hour to get served something to drink and even the water was lukewarm and had some stuff floating in it . Had I known what was coming I would have savored the mysterious floating gunk because it was the best thing I ate at this dump . After about an hour and a half we were served our entrees although we watched them sit under the heat lamps for 20 minutes beforehand . I had the yellowfin tuna special which was dry and indescribably nasty and smelled foul . It was however served with 4 green beans . The steaks were overcooked some in our group wisely choosing to send the meals back and skip dinner . They came with some strange salt crusted balls they claimed were potatoes but tasted more like salt crusted balls if you know what I mean . It took about another 45 minutes to get our checks which were wrong when they arrived . The meals ranged from $38 for a serving of three scallops served atop gummy rice to $60 for the steak that would have been Applebees quality at best had it been correctly cooked - which it was not . This was not my first bad meal in Madison but it was the first one I consider cruel and abusive to my mouth . I bought my first tongue scraper on my way home . Recommend to your enemies . ',\n",
       " 'On one side of Forbes Avenue sits Cherries Diner epitomizing tradition . On another sits Bluebird Kitchen blinding eyes and palates with sharp futuristic decor and a forward - looking menu . Yet both are comfortable and appealing to me in every way and in their own way . Will Old Pittsburgh be alienated by the shiny novelty of Bluebird Kitchen? Will Young Pittsburgh embrace Bluebird Kitchen and reject Cherries as a relic? Can they coexist? I truly hope so . The other morning a change in my schedule presented me with no other breakfast mission than to try Bluebird Kitchen . Being a blue - collar man in the morning I was hollow in the belly . My innards were disturbed and gnarling . My first meal consisted of Sweet Potato Corned Beef Hash (a small order) Pastrami Cured Salmon Black and White Trifle and freshly - squeezed orange juice . The hash was unorthodox resembling dirty pasta in a cardboard Chinese takeout container . This was not a heavy thick oily hash one gets from a can nor was it crisped via a flat top grill . Not that I do not enjoy those manners of corned beef hash as well but this put my culinary mind in a trick . Instead of cubes drowning in a muddy sea of red meat the potatoes were stringy again like spaghetti and bits of corned beef and bacon merely acted as flavorings with those potato tendrils being the central component . Was an Asian influence at work here? I do not know but I do know that sugar salt and starch butted heads within that box and created a very enthralling side dish that was almost grotesque to behold yet possessive of gorgeous flavor and an odd but welcome al dente brittle texture . And if I did not think that breakfast could get more complex there was THAT sandwich . . . I would been craving salmon and cream cheese in some configuration for a little while now and BK (not he the Burger King who should be killed) satisfied that yen tenfold . The \"house cured\" salmon tasted like a wonderfully warmed - through smooth soft silky sashimi that was only rounded - out by the inclusion of the mild white velvet of the cream cheese spread . Cucumber brought the crunch factor oven - dried tomato acted as the natural sugars and with a pretzelesque bagel came the chew and the brine . A cool (literally as well as figuratively) calculated supraintelligent breakfast sandwich PCS owns the sunrise much like the hash did ; with subtle tastes and punctuating mouthfeel . I came close to ordering the Breakfast Bread Pudding but when I saw that cup with the decadent to behold ebony ivory filling and was told what as in it my plans were diverted . I get the feeling that some stale brownies needed to be used up (BK was selling ones of the mint variety) and if that was the case then there was no more brilliant way than to break them up into bricks suffocate them with a luxuriously corrupt funereal white buttercream and rain chocolate syrup death onto this grave for the day - old and baked . My pupils disappeared as I scooped each spoonful into my jaws as evidenced by the morbidly curious stares I received from passersby while seated near a window . Too debauched to be had on such a radiant cockcrow morning soon fell to mourning . . . http : www . youtube . com watch?v = nMg80LiH_kYAnd after finishing my deathly dessert I turned to the young woman that waited on me threw two thumbs up in the air and cracked a smile which she returned this edible battle for my soul only replenishing it . The cup of tart nutritious pressed afresh sunshine that was the orange juice rejuvenated my spirits further . Speaking of which the employees are decidedly hipster sans the slack snobbishness or casual disdain . I felt as if these tattooed fashionable whippersnappers were waiting for me to stop in so as to impress me . If so (yeah riiight like they were just dying for Yelp Darren W . to come by for all of these months) they succeeded . Their prices are affordable . Their fare is evidently creative and appetizing . Their service is relatively keen clever and kindly . Their local - first ethic is admirably conscientious of the land sea and air . Their all - inclusive enthusiasm is undeniable . What minion of the Redhead coos \"Hellloooo\" to every single patron as they walk in the door and towards the counter like she a friend of theirs? So why exactly are you still dancin with The Clown before work? Break the habit . Turn to the Bird . ',\n",

The sandwich was tasty and delicious but there is more room for them to move forward and get better and better ! I saw Chipotle Chicken Avocado and my mouth was watery I ordered it and I could not wait to get my order . As the name signifies \"Chipotle Chicken Avocado\" I thought I would get a sandwich with rich amount of avocado but when I had the first bite there was only a small amount of avocado . Bite after bite and I was looking to see and taste more avocados but there was only a very thin layer of avocado spread . Thin layer of avocado killed my excitement for this sandwich . I also tried their chicken noodle soup but not very flavorful tho ! Note*If you are hungry one sandwich is not enough to fill you up so make sure to get 2 sandwiches ! ',\n",

Specials : - Happy Hour ; Mon - Thurs 5PM - 7PM $6 small bites and $6 drinks (wine draft beer and well drinks) - Half Off Wine Bottles ; ALL DAY Thurs ! I came here with one of my girlfriends on a Thursday for Happy Hour . We sat at the bar and shared a bottle of Davis Bynum Chardonnay (since all bottles were half off ! ) My friend ordered the wood roasted eggplant spread and I ordered the cheese and salami board . She did not care for her eggplant spread but I love charcuterie and thought this board was well worth the $6 ! A few meat selections 2 slices of cheese bread and an apricot or peach like chutney jelly . All of it was delicious and paired perfectly with the Chardonnay . The bartenders were nice and attentive - no complaints there ! I really enjoyed my overall experience and look forward to coming back .

       " 'We stopped here mid - afternoon yesterday and sat down in front of the worst bartender server ever in the history of yuppie restaurant service . I mean this sort of place with the generic one - half - step - above Olive Garden furnishings is where you would expect to find obsequious servers with cheap smiles to match the character of the interior design . Cornerstone no doubt employs such good souls however one bad soul has ruined any good thing I could say about this place . Our unfriendly bartender was gruff beyond what one could expect at the nastiest of dive bars . Other than one Michelob Ultra drinking regular we were his only customers . He ignored us for what he thought was long enough for us to make a decision at which point he came over and asked \"you know what you want?\" But damn he underestimated the power of this girl indecision what a bother . I told him that I was undecided between two different weiss beers they had on draft . He promptly turned around and walked away . During his absence I decided to just not get a beer in fact to spend as little money as possible because this guy had the air of being the owner (who else could get away with being such an asshole) whom I did not want to support . So eventually my partner got his beer (which he could have ordered much earlier if this guy had a molecule of patience) and we ordered one entree a mushroom sandwich to share with a salad and also a side order of sweet potato fries . Except for some rotten salad greens the food was good . This could probably be a three star review if it was not for the hostile environment that we experienced . To top it all off as soon as we got up to leave he came over to the book to check his tip (guess what it was not very good ! ) and sarcastically yelled after us \"thanks A LOT\" followed by some indiscernible muttering . My genuine tip : fucking retire ; play golf or travel the country in an RV or something just spare the public your unpleasantness . ',\n",
       " 'OK . This place has to make it in this somewhat jinxed location . First a never ending stream of Mexican restaurants and the last tenant was a Hawaiian BBQ with decent but not striking food . These folks have completely redone the space . The sandwich and onion rings I had were excellent . The folks running the place are friendly and efficient . When you are placing the order they ask all sorts of questions to make sure it comes out the way you want it not just the way they want to make it . While the place was not crowded it was obvious several of the folks eating there or picking up to go orders were already regular customers . There are lots of items on the menu and I will be back to try some more of them . ',\n",

Also beware of bartenders one in particular named Breanna . She gives her number out to any guy . She is what most people will consider a home wrecker . Does not bother to ask if the guy is married relationship and will go out of her way to hand them her number . If you ask her to stop messaging or talking to your guy she will continue to do so . Very disrespectful person I cannot believe they hire individuals like that . Definitely will not be returning to that place . ',\n",
       " '3 & 1 2 STARS Little City Grille is small on size but big on charm . It is a small mom & pop diner off Nevada Way where the road transitions from a strip of motels into the Boulder City Central Business District . I had been to Little City Grille two times before hiking adventures near Boulder City . The first time was last Memorial Day and the second was the day before yesterday on Earth Day . As soon as I stepped inside the diminutive mom & pop shop it was a leap back in time . Throughout the room there are pictures and memorbelia of Boulder City and humorous sayings . The most memorable is a picture that says \"Welcome friends\" on the wall . Everywhere my eyes roamed I would take in pictures of Boulder City . For the most part my eyes would roam on the menu and table . By the way every table features pictures of Boulder City residents . When I looked at the menu I observed that the prices are not reflective of another era . The majority of the breakfast and lunch plates cost over $8 . The cup of coffee was near $3 . Breakfast Specials were nonexistent . When I dined here on Memorial Day 2015 I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger with fries . I was not crazy over both the burger and fries . Time passed by and I delayed writing this review . Fast forward to Earth Day 2016 and I returned here for a pre - hiking breakfast . On this weekday morning it is was far less busy than Memorial Day last year . This created a cozy breakfast setting . I was at ease walking around looking at the pictures . My waitress and possibly an owner was warm and would check up on me . As soon as I walked inside Gina told me to sit anywhere . I passed over sitting at the counter where I could see them make the food . I passed over sitting on the patio overlooking Nevada Way . I walked a few feet to a comfortable booth surrounded by pictures model cars and memorbelia . One of the pictures was the password for the Internet . My attentive waitress would point out that they were all caps . I would point out that I wanted the BLT ($6 . 95) . Gina would point out that they only had the breakfast potatoes instead of what normally comes with it . I was thinking to myself that the regular fries were nothing to write home about . However the breakfast potatoes were something to write home about . They were outstanding ! The delectable seasoning complimented the potatoes onions and peppers . Ultimately the breakfast potatoes complimented the BLT that I personally requested a lot of mayonnaise on . The nice thing about tiny restaurants is that when you realize that you realize you forgot to tell the waitress about adding a lot of mayonnaise she is a few steps away . The BLT with mayonnaise is more than comfort food . I also use it as a bellwether of quality . I was so much more impressed with their BLT than the mushroom Swiss burger . The sandwich was loaded with bacon fresh tomatoes and mayonnaise then topped with mayonnaise . Good stuff ! The $3 bottomless coffee was also good . If I had drunk enough of it to the point of needing to visit the rest room it would be necessary to leave the restaurant . The restroom is in back of the building . Gina did not rush me . When I was finished eating the food she left me with the check and a Hershey Kiss . The Hershey Kiss next to the check was a cute touch that leaves a last impression that Little City Grille is a mom and pop restaurant small on size but big on charm . ',\n",
       " 'My brother a prolific Charlotte Yelp Elitist had been raving about JJ \"Soon To Be Famous\" Onion Rings so I had to come see for myself . Walking in we found ourselves transported to a classic diner space . You walk up and place your order then have a seat . Thankfully we beat the lunch rush since there was not a line yet . Also appreciated how clean it was inside . I ordered a Single Dog Combo with the Chili Cheese Coney Dog and subbed the fries for the onion rings . My brother did the same thing except he ordered the Sonoran (Southwestern Style) . The Chili Cheese dog was delicious . The bun held up the dog and fixins . The onion rings were out of this world ! Thin rings like onion straws that also reminded me of The Outback Steakhouse Bloomin Onion but a way better version . Excellent seasoning in the batter and crispy texture . Some parts could be a little greasy but it worth it . I would come back just to order the rings but the dogs are also great . ',\n",
       " 'It is never a wrong time for pizza so here I am at Little Caesars . There is also a plus in stopping here besides enjoying great pizza I do not have to make it . With this priceless advice and such great prices on their pizza and assorted styles of bread it is a win win . This store as most is a to go store but I learned today that they even have lunch specials too . One can purchase a small individual size pizza (this is a throw back such as the Pizza Hut individual deep dish pizza they used to sell) and a 20 oz bottle of a Pepsi product for $5 . What a deal?Although I did not take advantage of this deal I was feeding the twins too . The cashier was very friendly and had a great sense of humor . I opted for a pepperoni pizza but with the extra most bestest . This pepperoni pizza has a better crust than the regular pepperoni pizza but it has an abundant amount of pepperoni . It has been too long since I had tried there craze bread but it is just like I remembered it . The crazy bread goes best with their crazy marina sauce too . They have a delicious looking new item called Italian cheese bread and it was so great . The cheese bread had so much mozzarella and the garlic was delicious too in the crust . This is the way to celebrate Wednesday and not have to make lunch ! ',\n",

I was definitely under - dressed but I was too hungry to care . We sat at the bar while waiting on our other friend . We got a booth . The seats were big nice and comfy . The table has a marble top . The chandelier was so pretty and I love how they have flowers spell out \"The Sparklings\" in front . We shared a bunch of appetizers and a bottle of sparkling wine . Our bartender server with wild hair seemed abrasive at first but he loosened up quick when my friend called him out and gave him a hard time the whole night . It was pretty hilarious . Truffle Parmesan Fries :Comes with ketchup and lemon garlic sauce . The lemon garlic sauce tasted like it had dill in it . The fries were crisp and were a cross between skinny fries and steak fries in terms of thickness and texture . Bacon and Dates Wrapped Meatball :I like bacon - wrapped dates . I like good meatballs .

I do not like beets but this was pretty amazing . It looked pretty and the textures were wonderful . Soft beets crisp apples and walnuts . 4 5Crispy Gnocchi :Gnocchi in pesto with Italian sausage peas and candied walnuts . I love pesto and the sauce was spot on . The gnocchi was not as crispy as I expected . 4 5Grilled Octopus :Baby octopus marinated in soy sauce . It has a nice char to it . A different server put our plate of octopus on our table and said \"here your octopuses\" which started a short - lived debate . He told us \"octopi is actually wrong . . . I looked it up\" . Well octopuses and octopi are both correct actually endtangent . 4 . 5 5I did not feel too under - dressed when I saw some lady wearing booty shorts and sneakers .

The rest being mere novelty items on the menu for the benefit of your in - laws from Up North or for shirt - tail cousins from East Texas and the rest of the Deep South who eat pigs . I am truly sorry . I liked the owner couple that served me and understand that she has Austin roots . My brisket was tender throughout but inside the smoke ring it was bland and flavorless . I wish them success all the same but I wo not be back . You folks from New Jersey that like Joe Outback Honey Bears Daves or Chili for links baby backs pork or (for God sake) pastrami . . . . . keep on plugging this place with 5 stars .

Central Texans . . . the closest thing to down home is still Rudy at I - 10 and Chandler Blvd . . P . S . I was in Austin last month and asked an expert why the Líl Miss brisket tasted like roast beef in the center . He said it was because they did not smoke it long enough . He said it was tender in the middle because it continued to cook in the foil after it was removed from the smoker . Maybe I was there on an unusual day when somebody was sick or hungover or something . I do not know . Everybody else must have known because there was no line at all and they were not sold out at 3 p . m . I wo not be back to find out . I do not trust Yelp reviews anymore they are mostly yuppie - huffy and with snowbirds from New Jersey writing glowing reviews about barbecued pastrami at Li l Miss or foie gras tacos at The Mission in Scottsdale .

       " 'Came here for their Saturday brunch lunch special with like 13 people they spread out the table for us in the center and the service was pretty good . We all took advantage of their $20 . 12 lunch special and most of us ordered different things . . . as an appetizer I opted for the \"Canadian Classic\" - Willy Krauch Nova Scotia Smoked Salmon cream cheese red onion & the World Famous St . Viateur Bagel from Montreal - the salmon was fresh and delicious the cream cheese was regular cream cheese not bad - not drool - worthy the bagel . . . let talk about the bagel shall we? I could have played hockey with this lil sesame covered object . I m not sure if the bagel was stale or if it was just not meant to be tasty but me and one of my friends ended up devouring our slabs of smoked salmon with the complimentary bread that was served in baskets . . . that bread was warm fluffy and tasty . For my main course I went with the Lavraki (grilled Mediterranean seabass) which I believe was grilled in a delightful mix of lemon butter and olive oil - this was DELICIOUS . Each bite was amazing and even better when I squeezed fresh lemon all over it . For desert I was saddened that they had no options in the vanilla or chocolate family so I went with their Walnut Pie with Kaimaki ice cream . . . I m not a pie person so I supposed I m biased but I did not like this pie one bit and the Kaimaki ice cream was incredibly fragrant and tasted like dirt which after looking \"Kaimaki\" up and learning that it made using a powder made from the root of an orchid plant makes perfect sense . Again this must be an aquired taste . . . one I just have not aquired . Cocktails were great no complaints there . Was tempted to give this place 4 stars but really felt it was more like 3 . 5 . . . so I m giving it 3 stars because on Yelp that means \"A - OK\" and that exactly what this place was . A - Ok .

When we got there I was really happy the location is so nice right by the water and near the bota spa . . but honeslty for 11$ a lobster roll its really nothing special they use a really cheap brand of bread . Also they could atleast butter the rolls or press them? And they sell bags of chips . I dont know about you but if your already serving homemade lobster rolls why dont you make your own fries? They have a wood oven to make pizzas and the couple beside me had it it looked great . I guess I got a little disappointed because you kinda expect more than a bag of chips & cheap bread . By all means you dont want to serve homeade fries no problem but atleast be unique and make your own . The place really looks like a small box its really cool . It sucks when you have something going on with downgrading quality . I think the location really helps with the place . . otherwise good luck ! ',\n",

My first visit was for the Yelp Adopt - A - Family UYE (kudos to Metro for hosting and giving us a sampling of many of your fine French menu items) . We had fun that night . . . highlights in my eyes were the the Gin Fizz cocktail that Ty L ordered - he allowed many of us to sample it and it was delicious ! (I m not even a gin drinker) . I also enjoyed the flatbread and fried oysters . Great wine selection too ! After the UYE a few of us stayed for dinner - while I really enjoyed the vegetable salad the cod was not amazing (maybe it was the preparation with the leeks that I was not a fan of but so be it - I know not to order that next time ! ) I will say a major standout for all of us was the beignets - OMG ! Served warm with dipping sauce these are a must order when you visit Metro ! I returned for brunch the following Sunday and let me tell you - brunch is the way to go ! Between Jared and I we had three menu items . I went with the egg white omelette (served with mushrooms spinach tomato and gruyere cheese) - I chose grits as my side and they were even better than the grits I remember eating when I lived in the South ! He had steak and eggs and the quiche . We both cleaned our plates . Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and coffee also made appearances at our table . Both were great but a tip to Metro - I prefer my grapefruit juice without ice next time ! Jason was our server for brunch Chad was our server for dinner and GM Bill was friendly and helpful as always . . . I like the shirts that the waiters wear - go check em out ! I know I will be returning for brunch again real soon . Maybe I will see you there ! ',\n",
       " 'Prior to living in the great state of AZ my wife and I used to come out to vacation here in Phoenix Scottsdale . A little over 4 years ago during one of our visits we decided to hit up Pizzeria Bianco down on Adams Ave . I had waited years to try it out and when I finally got to try it I was a bit disappointed . (See review here http : www . yelp . com biz pizzeria - bianco - phoenix?hrid = bwzEu7e35wv532D4WMB6VA ) . I thought it was too expensive for what we got plus it was not the heavenly pizza experience that some people described it to be . Fast forward 4 years I live here now (AZ) and saw that Bianco has branched out and opened a spot over here on 20th Street . I had my mind made up since last week that on my day off I would head down and get a Margherita pizza . That is exactly what I did today . Would it be better than last time? We shall see . . . . . . . . . I cruised down to the place and found a parking spot in the lot . I had been down here a few weeks prior in order to go to Whole Foods . Pizzeria Bianco is located behind Whole Foods and to the left a little bit (if you are looking at Whole Foods from 20th St) . I walked in and was immediately welcomed by a nice young fellow . He asked if I wanted to sit inside or outside . It was a nice breezy day so I decided to sit outside . They have a cool little patio which also lets you do some people watching if you so choose . My waitress brought over a glass of water and I placed my order for a Margherita Pizza . A few minutes later my pizza was ready . Here is how it was . . . . . . . . . . Margherita Pizza ($15 . 00) - This thing looked great ! 6 slices of food porn ! The crust had a nice slight char to it the cheese was melted perfectly the crushed tomatoes and sauce were vibrant and there were a couple of leaves of fresh basil layered on top . It smelled delicious too ! Unfortunately that was the highlight of this pizza . . . the look of it ! I picked up a slice and noticed that it was incredibly thin . We are talking paper thin . . . literally ! I remembered from the first time I went to the OG location my big beef was that the pizza was too thin . Hey I m all about a thin crust pizza and actually prefer a thinner crust over any other style This crust was so thin you could pretty much see through the dough . If you were ever a prisoner behind huge steel doors this pizza still may have a chance to slide under the most minuscule opening of light . I seriously do not know how this dough does not just disintegrate when you pick it up ! I tore each slice in half so that I could fold up the thin dough and eat it without having the cheese droop off . The tomatoes cheese and basil that they use are delicious ! The outer crust even had a nice chew to it and was my favorite part of the pizza . That razor thin dough turned me off though ! I could have EASILY eaten 2 pizzas just because of the thinness . Overall for $15 . 00 I wanted more . It was a $20 . 00 pizza after tax and tip . The taste of the pizza was nice fresh and tasty but the value was is horrible . Not sure if I will be back . I have 5 other pizza joints in Phoenix that I would frequent before here . I guess all I can do is try his other spot (Pane Bianco) for pizza one evening . If it exactly like this and the Adams ave one we may have just looked at strike 3 and struck out ! We shall see . . . . . . . . . . . . ',\n",
       " 'Note : If you are having trouble finding CTS look for Whitehall Tire Service . It right across the street from them and is in the same storefront once occupied by the banal Amaro Pizza . Once again hooray for immigration ! I will take a decent Mexican restaurant over a bad pizza joint any day of the year y know? So I come home this evening after pulling more overtime and find table full of Mexican takeout waiting for me . In styrofoam containers sat a beef taco a chicken enchilada a carne asada burrito cups of fiery red and green sauces and a small plastic pouch of pickled carrot slices that surrounded one fat sumbitch of a pepper . And hey I must tip the sombrero to em for it was all above average fast food that was easily several hundred yards superior to what you would find at a Taco Bell . All of the meat was tender and well - seasoned (the taco beef was probably the highlight for me) . The white tortillas were nicely doughy . The yellow tortillas had a grainy artisanal quality that shouted \"freshness\" to the hills . Golf claps are in order . If THIS is \"authentic \" then authentic is pretty damn good but to my palate CTS menu is merely ON THE SAME LEVEL as any of the other Mexican restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh . I did not find what I had to be mindblowing or revelatory in any way and based on that CTS certainly does not eviscerate Mad Mex Cocina Mendoza or Mexi - Casa . Nor is CTS very appetizing fare evidence that Pittsburghers are backward tasteless and have been deprived for uncounted years as the smug gloating derisive regionally - bigoted initial review would lead an outsider to believe . Nonetheless CTS offers quick inexpensive family - pleasing ethnic grub that is not pizza or Chinese for a change and that alone makes them worth your while CTS being an undoubtedly welcome addition to the South Hills particularly the Saw Mill Run Boulevard corridor . We have yet another go - to joint and if you live in this general area so do you . By all means give them your commerce . ',\n",
       " 'Come hungry for a pleasant stop near Concord MillsWe were out today helping my Stepson and his wife pick up some patio furniture and go get some things for our upcoming trip to Marietta Ga for a some to be 3 year olds birthday when lunchtime rolled around . We had eaten at Iron Thunder years ago but had not been back lately . That is not to say we have not dined at one of their sister locations in Mooresville . Same menu for Concord Mooresville and also Hickory . It a bit spartan when you walk in with most of the tables being hightops around the edge of the room . Still like most sports bars plenty of big screen TV around the room and for a change this was the first Sports Bar I have been to that had competition Rodeo on . We were promptly seated and the normal sequence of presentation of menu and taking beverage orders followed returning with the beverages and taking our lunch order in a very timely fashion . My wife ordered the Crab Balls appetizer and the Soup of the Day which was a Brandied Onion Mushroom soup in lieu of a full entree . I ordered the Buffalo Chichen Sandwich with Fries as a side . I had that at Mooresvillle and had enjoyed it there so tried it again . My wife liked her meal and commented that the Soup and a nice taste and texture to it . As far my Sandwich first of all I could not believe the size of the thing . Looking at it I expected it to be very dry because of the crust on the outside but just beneath the crust was a very flavorful bird cooked just right . Hats off to the kitchen staff although i will point out the fries were a bit under cooked and needed more time in the fryer . I was a good lunch and I would recommend it as a different place to have a nice lunch in the Concord Mills area . It next door to the Harley Davidson shop which is probably part of the origin of the name for the restaurant . This is the oldest of the three restaurants and the one in Hickory is also next to a motorcycle dealer . ',\n",

The place was HUGE and actually accommodates the amount of people they actually let in did not feel sardine - y whatsoever . 2 .

Bouncers workers that I encountered were really easy to work talk with which was nice and made my life a lot easier . 5 . Mostly good vibes but will explain the rest below . . . . Cons : 1 . I met a lot of people this past weekend that were totally sending me good vibes but I also met some dicks as well (pardon my language) . For some reason these two tables just felt super entitled because they had a table . Uhh first off I was not there to leech and secondly you should thank me for wasting all my sunblock on your sunburnt a$$es ! SMH ! 2 . Drinks are freaking expensive ! One cup is $21 before tax and the reuseable cup was $99 before tax . My heart literally broke into pieces when I heard that . 3 . Locker storage room is managed by employees of the club . The initial cost is $25 but it is an additional $5 every time you want to get something out . Better off paying for the usual ones in my opinion but that not even an option here :(Final Verdict : Pros outweigh the cons thumbs up ! ',\n",

Squirrel Hill is not my neighborhood so I had to trust the tastes of my friends and I m glad I did . This joint rocked my world . I was in a group of 11 people so that meant some awesome non committal family style sharing was going on . I personally ordered beef stew soup and a pork belly slider and a Thai bubble tea . First off the slider is huge it a slugger ! Slider to me would be those lil tiny hamburgers from that glistening castle in the sky known as White Castle . It comes on a steamed bun amazing . The meat was perfect not greasy and the ground up peanuts gave it a sweet appeal . I also tried the soup dumplings . What magical sacks of flavor are these ????? Give the man or woman who figured out you could steam cook a dumpling with liquid inside a high five . The spicy eggplant tasted savory just like meat making me reconsider my eating ways til I remembered how good fried chicken is . I tried the fried tofu just meh baby Bok Choy meh and the cucumber pickle was raw . . . . My beef soup was ok and I brought it home to my Taiwanese partner who declared it ok to good but this is a man who eats this stuff in Taipei every year . My son enjoyed his plain wide noodles and all was right with the world . ',\n",

We started off by trying a couple of their appetizers ; the crab wontons and the coconut shrimp . Both were pretty tasty and were served with a sweet and tangy tropical sauce that I quite enjoyed . I do wish that the crab wontons would have been a bit crunchier though . For our main dish we split the \"F n Sliders\" which were these mini burgers loaded with strips of steak . They were not too bad but were pretty messy and hard to eat without feeling like a slob . The best thing we had was probably the Tom Kai Gai soup . . . slightly spicy but very flavorful . This is the type of place that would probably work a little better with more of a Pei - Wei type of set up it has more of a casual almost bar - like atmosphere . . . it does not feel like you are at an Asian restaurant when you are here . In the end . . . it a cool concept (Asian dishes with more traditional American fusions) it just did not wow me like it could have . Still it a solid spot with a fun menu that you should try . 3 . 5 5 . ',\n",

Our server had some recommendations (maybe since we were taking too long making a decision) and the one we went with was freakin awesome . The Sen Mee Kang Pou which was a homemade crab curry with thin rice noodle was a slam dunk for both my wife and I . She said it was one of the best Thai dishes she ever had and I have to agree . If everything the waiter recommended was this good then I would have had him pick everything . We also tried the Miang Pou . That was a lettuce wrap with crab meat ginger roasted coconut peanut chili lime and onion . Nice starter and I liked how the filling was arranged in the lettuce to where you get the crab and spice at the end of it . It was kind of like an appetizer money shot if you will . The final dish was the green curry which I was not too into getting . My wife always wants it but I was sure glad we ended up having it because it was terrific . The curry had grilled pork bamboo shoots and eggplant . The sauce was really good but the pork was cooked perfectly . It was so tender and tasty that it made the whole dish for me . That a protein I never consider for Thai curry but I definitely would now . Sure they have all the usual items any Thai restaurant does but I do not think that what you should come here for . Pad Thai schmad Thai yaaawwwwwn . Quail eggs Chilean sea bass lobster and some of the more creative dishes is what I look forward to trying on future visits . ',\n",

So she put them in a nice little box to hold them and we left . The price is high but less than Sprinkles so we thought we would give it a try . Later that night we tried the cupcakes one of them had deflated on one side . I am not sure why . Was it the frosting or the cake . It was in the high 80 driving home(yes it is Oct . ) But we put them in the fridge when we got home . Anyway the flavor is good on both . One a Sea Salt Caramel . It could of used more salty Caramel I think . The other was a Pumpkin Spice that was the one that deflated . Both good as well . Something you could try every 6 months or so . Parking is tough they have very limited spots on this end of the mall . ',\n",

Of course we had to try the lechon baboy Cebu style because my Asawa is from Cebu . They have a regular order that comes with rice for $10 . 99 or you can order a 1lb of lechon for $15 . 99 without rice . We decided to order the regular order with rice and Caldereta . The waitress told us the Caldereta does not come with rice . Anu ba yan ! Bakit walang kanin ! That was what I really wanted to say . Everybody knows you cannot have Ulam without rice . Oh and the cost for the Caldereta without rice was $10 . 99 and the portion was small . As for the lechon it was tasty but maybe 6 oz of pork belly . I will give it a couple of months before we come back and see if they make some changes . The only Filipino place that is more expensive is Max . If your prices are going to be expensive than at least make the portions big enough to share . ',\n",

That was last season . I have not been back to watch a Suns game since . However I finally made it to Arrogant Butcher for dinner with my Beloved wife . This is now to me one of the bright spots on Jefferson street in Downtown Phoenix ! We came here on a Saturday afternoon and were introduced to the subdued elegance that is the interior of this establishment . The layout is open inviting and bustling with a fair amount of patrons . The hostesses servers and bussers were cordial attentive polite and efficient . I had chose the Prime Rib Au Jus with Mashed Potatoes . Although the mashed potatoes were not particularly spectacular the slow roasted Prime Rib had a wonderfully succulent texture . Additionally it was well seasoned and delectable . . Each bite was just scrumptious . About the only downside of my meal selection was the asparagus . It seemed to have been overdone then chilled which took away most of the recognizable flavors that is inherent in this particular vegetable . My wife had the Green Chile Stew . That too was a big hit and the addition of a fried egg on top made for a particularly appetizing and visually appealing meal . She indicated that it was more Chili than Stew . But that did not detract from her overall positive comments and impression of her meal selection . The Salmon Rillette was also particularly notable as a spread on the wonderfully prepared and grilled bread . Simply savory ! ',\n",

Looks like third time a charm because I was finally able to step inside the glory that is Peppermill and loved it so much that I came back the next morning for brunch part two . Peppermill is like an 80s Club + Rainforest Cafe so basically my two favorite things combined (not even really joking about that) . Please take a moment to imagine neon pink and purple lights running along the ceiling lush fake foliage abound vibrant blue stained glass lamps overhanging each table while you enjoy your morning booze and breakfast . No seriously . IMAGINE . Both mornings we dropped in and put our names down before heading into the mysterious \"Fireside Lounge\" door . The 80s club vibe kicks up about 200 notches here as you descend into a circular pit complete with rusted orange sofas and outdated music videos on a tv that hovers above a circular pool and fire pit . It feels good for about 18 second before it absolutely too hot to be down there but you do not leave because it just . too . cool . Start off by enjoying a cocktail in any variety (A sweet strawberry take on the mimosa? A ridiculous huge daquiri in a glass the size of a baby head? Even coffee with baileys will do ya ! ) served by a young lady in a satin prom dress before being whisked away to your dining experience . Breakfast on both mornings was deelish . Morning A introduced me to the eggs benedict while Morning B seemed fine for the chorizo . Both were extra tasty . On Morning B I asked if an iced coffee was a possibility though it was not on the menu - the server happily accommodated by pouring coffee over ice into an ice cream sundae glass . I also love that coffee comes with options like vanilla creamer and RAINBOW SUGAR ! Pretty much I wanna be here like erry day . ',\n",

Thankfully the moment I stepped into SWAN Adam Sandler bathing became an afterthought . SWAN boast three qualities : Large portions creative diner bistro eats and efficient service . Plus you cannot help but love the roaring 1950s decor . Literally everything is from the 1950s including the bartenders glasses . . . or maybe they are the ray ban new generation . You will never know with the hipster fashions . Back to the decor and ambiance . Walking into Swan is a real treat (besides the crazy line ups and lack of room to stand) . The peach & brown cozy booths with personalized hooks the aging but proud varnished wood bar the large coca cola cooler and the rickety silver vintage fan in the corner of the room are tributes to the golden era with a contemporary punch . Before the current owners took over the space over a decade ago she was not quite the white swan . . . but oh how times have changed . It a great place to come with friends to get cozy by squeezing into their booths and enjoying a vibe of the 50s . The Food . If you are hungry go to SWAN . Not only because the portions are massive but because you wo not be disappointed by the flavor . The chef really likes to get creative with his dishes . Hence the oyster pancetta omelet (SIDE NOTE : I have heard mixed reviews . My friend tried it and it was not for her) . I always go for the daily omelet and have yet to be disappointed . (I have also tried the Huevos and The Swan Breakfast which are stellar choices)The best omelet I had : Mixed mushrooms with spinach and brie cheese . I did not want to share which is a big thing for me . . . I m usually asking the whole table to try what I have ordered including the people sitting next to us . This one though was just too good too share . The chef does not stop there . You have a choice of home - fries or salad . The salad is a mixed greens with a savory balsamic and the home - fries taste char grilled with a sidekick or charred onions . They also include a charred tomato with most of their dishes . For $10 it a steal . SIDENOTES :1 . Get there early . By 12 :30P this place is jammed and you will be waiting 30 minutes to eat . They are first turn around is usually around 12PM . 2 . Service is incredibly efficient . Before you can even ask for something they have already brought it to you . 3 . The servers seem a bit apathetic but thats just their thing do not take it personally . As its been said I m a bit of a brunch whore and it takes a lot to impress me . SWAN has rustled this hussies feathers and she will definitely be back for more . ',\n",

Laurent not too far from the Pont Jacques - Cartier . Todai is known in California for it all you can eat sushi in mass quantities buffet style . PF Chang that Scottsdale AZ HQ would Chinese chain is known for its large faux statues . Sushi Palace combines these . The place is very large seating over 100 people maybe up to 200 if you used every seat . The space has high ceilings and is airy with large columns covered with ancient Chinese calligraphy and above the sushi counter and kitchen large Buddha statues on the upper half of the wall . These are not Japanese looking Buddhas but skinnier Chinese looking ones . Nonetheless they add to the PF Chang likeness of the massive horses they use in front of those faux Chinese eateries . And speaking of faux this is faux Japanese as it is owned and staffed with Chinese . And although it is an AYCE place it is not a buffet . You sit get a waiter order off little sushi or other item check lists and they go order it for you from the cooks chefs under the Buddhas . They do have a large selection and variety of foods . They carry most common Nigiri sushi items (except Uni and other more exotics) and some sashimi as well . And they offer other popular Japanese dishes like Yakitori au Boeuf and Tempura aux Crevettes . Actually they have 5 different Yakitoris and Tempura selections . But if you feel like mixing your Japanese with Chinese try the Poisson Szechuannais ou L agneau Mongolien . Thinking about noodles? They have Pad Thai au Poulet ou Boeuf ou Udon . They even have on Vendredis et Samedis la Cuisine Chaude \"Boulettes de Pieuvre\" ou Takoyaki ! And being in Quebec they offer Escargots Gratines . Oh and if you want a little flavor of Korea order the Kimchi ! No Poutine though ! The service was actually pretty friendly and efficient and the food was not bad for an AYCE place . Dinner is $25 . 50 and you fill out your 2 tickets and when you are ready fill 2 more out till you are full .

I ordered one of the noodle dishes and really did not like the flavour at all (I love Thai food but was reminded of the smell of a public toilet when I took a bite) . I asked if it would be possible for me to send the dish back and order something else off the menu as I really could not finish the food . Mind you this is the first time I have tried to send food back at a restaurant since I m not that hard to please . The manager of the place comes and starts to argue with me about the quality of the food and essentially makes me feel as if I m wrong for really not liking the flavour . He tells me no other restaurant would ever allow a customer to send a dish back and replace it with another one without charging the patron for both dishes . I told him it standard practice to replace a dish if a patron does not like it and charge them for one dish . He then says if he does that for me he will have to do that for 100 other customers . I tell him not every patron you get will send a dish back ! He kept trying to argue with me so I just gave up and asked for a box to take the dish home for someone in the family because I had to pay the $15 for it anyway . It a shame I wo not ever be back to try the other dishes on the menu which may have been amazing . Probably the worst customer service experience I have ever had . ',\n",

The location is anime splashed with cool super hero artwork catering to a demographic mix of saggy jeans gamers hipsters and AnimAsians . The menu is simple yet overpriced for a burger and extra for choice of fries & drink (medium or large) . I saw Katsu on the menu & knew it usually dark meat but the cashier girl said it was white when I asked . I do not like dark meat but ordered it on her word as an employee who should know the menu . Fukume it was dark meat . The Jazz Fries with gravy & crack sauce sounded good but were not . It did not taste close to anything like gravy . . . more like a strange sweet sauce . The crack sauce tasted like a spicy mayo and fries were swimming in this stuff . I could not eat more than a couple bites . Not what I hoped for . Gravy & fries should taste like real gravy . I wanted to eat like a fat man here but did not enjoy it enough to spend the calories and I do not think a good value at $7 . 99 for a burger plus $5 . 50 extra for fries & drink .

The Weather Channel said there would be high wind warnings in effect and mentioned there would be the possibility of tornadoes along the road back to southern California . Well I thought if I m going to risk my life on the road during this storm I want to make damn sure I have a decent last meal . There was no doubt in my mind I had to have a falaffel sandwich from Amena Bakery . I had just tried the place for the first time the day before based on Misti Y excellent review . Her recommendation was as the English say spot on . Amena pita bread is heavenly . Tender and light but still strong enough to hold a bunch of falaffel patties and fixin . And as Misti notes they serve the falaffel sandwiches stuffed at Amena Bakery none of that bogus folded pita nonsense here ! (hello Daphne ! ) The falaffel patties have a great initial crunch and a flavorful interior . Absolutely delicious ! Each sandwich is made to order so the patties are plenty warm when you get them . When your sandwich is ready you specify what toppings you want . Without question this was the best falaffel sandwich I have had in the last 20 years . So now as I was getting ready for my redicuously dangerous trip home I was faced with that Yelp Profile question : what did I want for my last meal on Earth? It came down to a Super Taco from La Takiza or a falaffel sandwich from Amena Bakery . They are both excellent and I would have been happy to have either one in my belly when I kicked off . I ended up picking Amena because there are plenty of taco places where I live but nowhere to get a great falaffel sandwich . And Amena did not disappoint ! The woman at the register remembered me from the day before . She asked if I was going to try something new today . I really wanted to try the shwarma but I stuck with the falaffel . I also purchased a couple baklavas . I m not a big baklava fan but the free sample I got on my first visit was so delicious I had to have more ! So crunchy and sweet ! I cannot wait to go back to Amena ! I will have to go multiple times next time I m in town because I really want to try the shwarma and other items on the menu and I cannot wait to get another falafflel sandwich . Mikey C says : Thanks for turning me on to Amena Bakery Misti Y ! I love this place ! ',\n",
       " 'These are some seriously addicting soup dumplings . I m from New York and around the city and in Queens there are many soup dumpling houses . I have had good I have had bad and I have had amazing . These ones are incredible . 5 of us ordered 3 orders of pork soup dumplings and 2 ordered of crispy mini milk buns . The wait time for the food was practically non - existent . The piping hot dumplings were delivered to our table in no time . The soup inside were delicious but these were a little delicate . The addition of the chili oil was the icing on the cake . They were perfect and I had 5 to myself . The crispy mini milk buns were also delicious . They were brought over just as we were finishing our soup dumplings . They were hot and fresh . Eat bite was crispy sweet and just heavenly . This place is a serious dim sum contender and everyone should come here and order the entire menu . ',\n",

I had gotten to the stage where I had seen so many yelpers flooding this place and throwing up 5 star reviews I had decided it was time one day to make a special trip to see what the fuss was all about . Greeted by the connoisseur Amanda she explained all the wonderful and shear awesomeness that is AOF . Having gone through everything we decided the special birthday cake was the way to go as it was AOF birthday with my son grabbing the strawberry gelato we were set . After a few tastes my little dude decided shoveling was the best method to eat the gelato which I could it agree more . We polished off our cups with ease and in quick time too . If you have a little one they do have high chairs ! ! ! Kudos There are a million and one reviews about AOF and I concur with all of them .

       " 'Finally Downtown Summerlin is home to a coffee shop . After nearly three years customers no longer have to rely on the tiny Starbuck in Macy for a caffeine beverage . As of this past Monday just down the pedestrian pathway from Macy is the Cuppa . The Cuppa is just what Downtown Summerlin needed . It is a comfortable space to relax with a caffeinated beverage a bakery treat or sandwich . Today I relaxed with first a cup of drip coffee then a hazlenut late . \"Relaxed\" is the key word because there were plenty of seating arrangements to relax . It ironic that I visit a coffee house for a caffeine boost yet end up hanging out for a couple of hours mellow . The Cuppa did a fantastic job with creating an inviting third place which is the term for a hangout spot outside of home and work . This is evident before stepping inside . Bordering a pedestrianized streetscape in the heart of Downtown Summerlin the commodious patio attached to The Cuppa gives the passers - by a subconscious message that this is a place to stop and relax . On a cool April afternoon this was the place to enjoy a hazlenut late . The patio is furnished with tables and sofas . This is the ideal spot for Downtown Summerlin people watching . The inviting environment also permeates the large coffee shop . The walls are adorned with pictures of funny sayings . Halfway into the coffee shop is a library surrounded by plush seats . Bordering the left wall are plate glass windows overlooking Downtown Summerlin . To the right the counter takes up a large portion . I walked to the counter on two occasions to order . The overhead menu made ordering simple . Off the menu I ordered a medium coffee that costed $2 . 55 then later a medium hazlenut late that came to around $5 . 25 . Both times a friendly batista welcomed me . And both times they were in a mug . I thought more highly of the hazlenut late than the coffee . This is one of the deals where the quality was high but I personally did not agree with the taste . It one of those deals where several people would greatly appreciate it . It is a personal taste thing . Maybe next time I will try the pour over . On the other hand the hazlenut late was a taste that I preferred . What is nice is that there is a list of flavors to create the late . Next time I can switch it around with another flavor . I must add that it has a sweet taste for a sugar free syrup . The Cuppa is the missing piece that completed the Downtown Summerlin puzzle . Finally after 2 . 5 years Downtown Summerlin is home to a coffee shop where you can spend time in a relaxing setting with a quality caffeinated beverage . ',\n",

It had plenty of cheese and the veal was a tad chewy . . . The side of steamed vegetables were okay . Finished off with the tiramisu which was also lackluster and it had sugar crystals in it . . .

The restaurant definitely has a classy allure with a casual ambiance . They serve up some modern American meals with a hint of some cultural punch like the Banh Mi Poke Bowls and Chile Rellanos . Their drink selections are fun and extensive so take your time . I m a whiskey guy and the manager was willing to offer his suggestions and boy did he hit the spot for me ! I love it spicy and he did me well . Moving on to the food since this is a food review we started out with some brussel sprouts and steam clams . The brussel sprouts were slightly roasted and came along with some andouille sausage . Our steam clams came on a sweet and savory white wine tomato sauce . It was so good I asked for another round of flatbread to soak up the sauce ! Sweet and full of chunks of tomato ; it was savory with every bite ! For my entree I shot for the Fire Braised Short Ribs while my friend got their barramundi . She said it was well cooked and had a nice crispy skin . My short ribs were on fire ; but not what you think . It not spicy by any means but man it was tender to the point where I did not need a knife to cut through it . The farro risotto added a sweet creamy texture along with the vegetables which was cooked to perfection ; not raw but still had a fresh crisp crunch . Overall our service was phenomenal and attentive . The ambiance is fresh and cool ; definitely need to come back for just drinks and HH . Finally the food was popping especially to my palates ! Enjoy ! ',\n",
       " 'The rating is on solely on food quality . My brother and I came here after spending a day in Cleveland . We saw the $25 for $50 promotion so we decided to come down and use it . Yes it is an adult club and we knew it was a bit ridiculous to eat there as though it was just a regular restaurant but whatever . We were not sure what to expect but we figured \"why not?\" The food was surprising good with impressive portions . I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and the loaded fries . My brother ordered a hamburger and onion rings and we split boneless chicken and pizza . The chef had a great sense of item food prep time for every item came out at the same time (without any item being cold) . QUITE THE SKILL ; VERY RARE . The bartender waitress was great as well as so the manager . My brother enjoyed his part . I enjoyed mine . The fettuccine was to Italian restaurant quality . I was quite impressed . The fries were great as well . Both fresh and flavorful . Everything was great except for the pizza . Constructive criticism : modify the dough and add more seasoning in the sauce . Bottom line : no matter the reason for entering Diamond - your stomach and taste buds will leave happy . ',\n",

Also stoked because they deliver to my neighborhood which I would have guessed is outside the delivery area . Pizza was good . Crust good not too doughy or crispy . I would suggest not going too crazy on the custom toppings because they can add up and be pricy . Luckily the girl at the counter was nice and warned us the pizza we were crafting was going to end up being pretty expensive so we took her suggestion to revise and it was much more reasonable . They are definitely my go to pizza in the neighborhood . Have ordered from them several times and they are always consistent . Their wings are good salads are good - - really have not ordered anything that been a disappointment yet . They also have a good reasonably priced lunch slice special . Definitely worth stopping by if you are craving a slice and in the area . ',\n",

When I traveled to France the one thing I wanted most was cheese bread and wine and now after checking this place out I see I do not have to wait too long to get it . They have fresh bread croissants so many cheeses French and American so many to choose from I just need to invest in a raclette grill and I will be one happy girl ! They also have some amazing looking desserts custards éclairs beignets pastries macarons tarts .

The meat was like shavings and there was more bread with each bite than meat . The shavings of meat were falling out of the sandwich when I would pick it up to take a bite . A lot of other reviews talk about the sandwich being enough for 2 people however I was able to plow through a large sandwich with no problem . It came with a side of cajun fries and coleslaw . The coleslaw was terrible it had no flavor . The cajun fries however were damn good ! My wife and I shared some sort of bananas foster dessert and it was pretty good . Sodas come in a can and you do not get free refills so that not so good when I could easily drink 2 - 3 cans with my meal .

Amena bakery comes close to achieving perfection . The first time I went to Amena it was for their freshly baked pitas . AYUMYUMYUMYUM : that is me devouring a bag of delicious Amena pitas . They are like little clouds of joy in your mouth . I have never had a softer pita and they stay soft in your cupboard for a long time . Plus they are a good deal . I cannot remember how much exactly but you are going to be pleased . Do not settle for grocery store pitas when you can get these for the same price or cheaper . Moving on to the falafels as you may know I think the best falafels in town are at Mad Pita ; however these are a strong second and depending on my falafel mood I might choose Amena over Mad Pita . They are not as crispy and fried as I might enjoy but they do taste scrumptious . Plus the pita execution is solid . Have you already forgotten about the pitas? Well let me remind you : AYUMYUMYUMYUM ! At Amena they do a pocket style delivery so it is an easy handheld meal . No folding here . No fork and knife required . Plus they have the little salad bar where you choose what you want in your pita and are you ready for this I am not sure if you are but here you go : pickles . That right . They have precious pickles for your pita . I love pickles so when you add those to falafel you are talking about a potentially habit - forming taste combo .

The good : - the space is nice - The menu is very clearly labeled with vegetarian vegan and gluten free options - The beer options looked okay The bad : - The service was very laissez - faire and I felt like the wait staff hated us from the moment we walked in . Hey sorry to ruin your morning by being a customer during your open hours . . . my bad? - The restrooms were not clean and did not have soap - Our food took . . . . over 30 mins to arrive but less than 40 mins .

This was quickly remedied and not a big deal but other reviews have also noted that they are not 100% with the ticket accuracy . The eggs were cooked nicely - sincerely - but it would have been nice to have all my hot food come out at the same time . - The french toast . . . holy shit I am about to go on a rant here . Forgive my creative list spacing but this deserves it own review and I want to be sure to draw your attention to this epic ripoff of a dish . - - The french toast is 2 pieces of chemical bread of some sort (Dempsters wonderbread . . . I do not know you pick) breaded and fried (and takes 35m to make apparently) . Like gross - ass 1cm thin bread . - - That it . It is $8 . it comes with nothing else . (for comparison : the french toast at Sadies that comes with fruit and hashbrowns and 3 large pieces of beautiful french crusty bread . . . and is also vegan and the same price) . - - To add toppings (seems like they have a topping - du - jour) it an additional cost . - - REAL maple syrup is available . . . AT AN ADDITIONAL COST . - - Seriously the markup on the \"french toast\" piece of shit that was served for $10 has to be like a thousand percent ; 2 pieces of chemical bread . . . ~25c . batter . . . let just say 50c because it a vegan batter and I m sure they would argue it very pricey . Around 75c . At 8$ for a 75c item even including labour do not you think it should come with some fruit and hashbrowns and syrup? I was so offended when they put this down in front of the person I was with . I wanted to leave . - - I wish I had taken a photo of this because it was so awful . I cannot believe they could even deliver this to the table with a straight face . - - SURPRISE ! It was not good . - it cash only and they have a \"I get part of this fee hahaha\" gypsy bank machine prominently displayed for your convenience . In summary this is one of the most terrible executions (food wise) of a great idea that I was excited about that has had the misfortune of disappointing me in a long time . The food was not good the service was not good and it was expensive as all hell for one of the worst cumulative brunch experiences I have had in Toronto . I hope someone else buys this business fires these jokers and them starts pumping out some good food from the kitchen . ONLY then would I even CONSIDER returning .

       " 'The latest gem to grace Downtown is located at 6th & Carson . Bocho Sushi was born from an idea sparked by Dan Coughlin (Le Thai) backed by DTP and saw to fruition by Jimmy & Becky Chun (recently shuttered Tokyo Japanese Restaurant) . The Chun are at the helm they are no strangers to day - to - day operations after running their restaurant in Commercial Center for decades . At two weeks new Bocho Sushi has already reached hotspot status by serving up some delicious eats in a cozy setting . Our friends invited us to dinner upon our arrival every seat in the house was taken . Downstairs you will find the sushi bar with counter seating and upstairs there is intimate seating and large bar . The space has an industrial feel but I love when old buildings are spruced up and repurposed . The changes to the old Carson hotel have been top notch . This block was once forgotten but now? It alive and well . The menu will meet all of your sushi and sashimi loving needs . Plus there is an omakase offering for those seeking an adventurous experience . Sake beer and cocktails are free flowing . They have not yet begun serving wine however . We started with orders of Edamame ($3 . 50) and the Jalapeno Bomb ($5 . 95) . The bomb was \"bomb\" (har) seriously though it was delicious . It is hard to go wrong with deep fried jalapeno with spicy tuna and cream cheese . Unfortunately the Edamame was late to show . It served as dessert . A smorgasbord of rolls and sashimi followed : Yellowtail Lover ($9 . 95) Tiger Roll ($11 . 95) China Roll ($11 . 95) Spider Crab Roll ($12 . 95) Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche ($11 . 99) Salmon Sashimi ($6 . 25) . The were all well executed . The fish was delicately sliced and extremely fresh . My personal favorites were the Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche with serranos and spicy garlic ponzu and the China Roll with shrimp tempura and spicy tuna . Both selections were bursting with flavor . The staff was warm and friendly and our servers were patient & attentive the only flaw seems to be with timing . I m confident that they will get that resolved in time . It always takes a new restaurant a bit to find their rhythm . Bocho is currently open for dinner but lunch service is scheduled to begin next week . ',\n",

Ok why mention this? I dunno maybe I m about to Wok out some serious puns so strap yourself in it gonna be a woky ride ! We were headed back from a holiday party that we excused ourselves early on account of a lack of food and were desperate to find mid week eats that could wokommodate a variety of tastes - and be OPEN after 9pm (I realize these are not the best laid plans) . A quick yelp app search revealed that Wok of Flame was not only close by but open for another 90 minutes score ! ! ! We pulled into the lot and got ready to Wok out ! As others have mentioned we were advised that last call was about 45 minutes away (no worries) and that holiday pricing was in effect . I found this to be a little shitty since we were there so close to closing and essentially were accepting leftovers for dinner . Give your customers a break around these times when people are spending extra money while they Wok around the Christmas tree (or menorah) . It massive . That all you need to know easily there is seating for what appears to be 700 + . There had to be close to 200 people there when we arrived and 3 4 of the space was unseated . Not to be outdone the buffet areas are massive as well . The buffet includes dessert fruit area sushi area raw food (think Mongolian grill style) grill area white - person Chinese food (chicken balls and sweet and sour pork etc) a roast meat section (beef duck pork . . . impressive) and a salad section (there may have been more but notably there were so many sections it hard to keep track . One plus over a spot like the Mandarin is that all non - wokoholic beverages are also unlimited included and self - serve . Maybe it was the time of night (most likely) but all the food was sort of . . . bleghh . Not gross cooked fine or overcooked had been sitting for quite some time not great . . . basically palatable . The roasted duck was about 60% blubbery fat the sashimi did not look safe to eat as well as the Mongolian wok section raw meats . The safest things to eat it seemed were the white - person Chinese fare the deep fried selection salad bar and dessert - definitely not worth the money paid . I would be willing to give this place another try during peak turnover time but definitely never again during holidays pricing or late at night again . Eatcrest out . ',\n",

Though there was a wait to be seated at a booth + 1 and I opted to sit in the window with one long tall table and stools . Made for fun people watching especially those who tried to enter the restaurant from the wrong door . We would simply make eye contact point them in the right direction and have a laugh together . Better than most reality TV these days . . . Love wine served by the oz ! That alone deserves 4 - stars . After a few glasses of red chilly temps were the last thing on my mind . Paired nicely with lobster poutine and the Crow Nest : a combination of shrimp oysters and crab legs . YUM ! The rest of my evening in Ossington is a bit fuzzy (see the above paragraph mentioning wine by the oz) but Rock Lobster was the perfect way to start a Saturday night in Toronto . ',\n",

       " 'There something to be said for choosing one thing to do in life and doing it exceptionally well . Jim Chai Kee adheres to this philosophy . It raison d etre : wonton noodle soup . I know I know . . . if your only experience with won tons and soup is the tepid dishwater slopped forth from your local Manchu Wok you will wonder why the fuss?But if you are steeped in the greatest of brothy arts you appreciate a good bowl and you will come to appreciate Jim Chai Kee for the Souperstar it really is . Full disclosure : like many noodle - in - soup joints the ambiance is somewhat lacking . But then if you are planning on taking a first date for a big bowl of slurpy noodles your game plan needs work . Better to build rapport and a sense of trust . . . then get to slurping . Even still decor wo not win any awards unless you have a thing for hospital cafeterias . Fuller disclosure : wait staff are rude . I have written about varying degrees of unpleasant service here before . At Jim Chai Kee you just do not exist . You are a body at a table and you get what they bring you . . . and since there only about four menu items chances are they will bring the right food . Want water? Or tea? Get it your damn self . Seriously . Samovars and pitchers are set up for you to help yourself . Which is actually pretty convenient if you think about it . Fullest disclosure : I am advised that this is actually the Canadian location for an international chain . I m not sure if this is true and I m generally inclined to be harder on chains because I m not part of the 1% even if I do not always wanted to eat at yurt . So why does Jim Chai Kee rate four stars? Because . Soup . Is . Good . The broth itself is rich and golden ; improving on the current ridiculous \"bone broth\" trend by adding copious amounts of David Chang favourite ingredient : MSG . I used to be one of those people who took issue with MSG for health reasons . Now? Screw it . Delicious . Soup . The best broths all have a bit of viscosity ; it comes with the breakdown of collagen in whatever meat and bones you boil to make it . Jim Chai Kee soup passes the test . What do they put in your soup? Here are your choices? Want something else? Go to Mandarin :1) golf - ball - sized wontons bursting with fresh sghrimp cooked just to briny crunchiness . 2) beef in oyster sauce . Tender . Slighlty chewy . Great textural addition . 3) fish balls . As a lifelong gefilte fish afficionado I have never known what to make of this style of fish - ball . Vaguely fishy ; compressed to homogeneity contributing more firm texture than any kind of taste . . . but then who am I to argue with the world largest economy . 4) springy yellow wheat - and - egg noodles in massive quantities . 5) on the side Chinese greens . Again I know . . . but the bitter crunch provides excellent contrast . Wanna fancy up your bowl? There soya sauce and pungent chilis - in - oil and hoisin on the counter . I recommend chilis - in - oil on everything . Even on my post - meal Cream Egg McFlurry so I guess I m biased . Eat . Pay . Leave . If you are lucky after sitting a few minutes you will be sent off with a cheery \"GET OUT ! ! ! ! \" Four stars . ',\n",

       " 'Many of my friends keep raving about Everyday Noodles so much that I finally agreed to try the place out . We had to wait for close to 30 minutes even in a random Monday night . We were a group of four . We got six plates for the four of us . We got the drunken chicken the pork soup dumplings vegetable pork potstickers and pork belly bun as appetizers . The drunken chicken was unexpectedly cold . The pork belly bun was so so delicious ! It pork belly after all . I found the potstickers a little too greasy . The soup dumplings are a must try - I have no idea how they make those things . The dumplings are so juicy that they just call them soup dumplings . Besides the dim sum we got the shrimp pork wonton noodle soup and the hot and spicy wonton noodle . The noodle soup was really bland compared to the spicy noodle . I would highly recommend the latter . Three among us got Thai iced teas with different toppings . Unfortunately they were out of tapioca bubbles . I found the coconut topping better than grass and Mango pudding . ',\n",

After waiting for a little longer i call them to check if they were open . The gentleman on the other side tells me that they open at 5 :30 when it already 5 :45 . Anyway after i mention that we were waiting out side they take us in . We order a Mysore Masala Dosa (nothing Mysore about it) and a plain Dosa . We know that we were a little early than they had expected so we do not mind waiting . Finally the dosas arrive but without sambhar . The sambhar was served after we had finished more than half of our dosa ! Nothing great about the taste . Though i have to mention that the setup was above my expectation . I would clearly rate the ambience above that of Peacock competitors in the area . Oh ! Did i tell you about the final nail on the coffin . A hair in my dosa ! ! They did Offer a fresh one but my appetite was murdered by the sight of that hair . We were never charged for that dosa . Courtesy !

       " 'A recent lunch at Nee House changed my whole opinion of this restaurant . The crab and dried scallop fried rice was as good as the best fried rice I have eaten while living in Hong Kong . The rice kernels were perfectly al dente not greasy well - seasoned with the right restraint and the breath of the wok shined through deliciously . Fried rice and noodles shows the real skill of a chef - it requires good control of heat and timing . We also had the lobster with house special sauce . The lobster was plucked live from the tanks and weighed 2 . 75 lbs ($15 lb) so totaled approx . $40 . The sauce was addictively spicy with sliced jalapenos and ample ground black pepper with the crunch of green onion tops - a little less sugar in the sauce would have made it perfect . Young pea leaves are one of my favorite vegetables and usually available only at restaurants that see a lot of traffic from Chinese customers who appreciate them . They require some plucking to remove the less tender tendrils so tend to cost more . At Nee House it cost $13 . 50 per plate . This is on the high side but I cannot resist the flavor and texture of the small tender dark green leaves so have to order it wherever it served . I asked for it to be cooked with garlic . It was cooked to the perfect level (nothing is worse than overcooked vegetables) albeit a bit oily . The fried rice is more than enough reason to go back to Nee House . ',\n",

The dishes I have tried and loved include : tortilla espanola pollo colonial (better the first time I had it) soft lettuce with manchego cheese and rioja vinaigrette (the vinaigrette gave the dish a great flavor) pan con tomate calamari (I liked how there were not many squidy pieces since those are not my favorite) and the patatas bravas (better the second time I had them) .

My personal fave was the banh mi because it was overflowing with fatty pork belly . The Santa Fe was also a home run because of their homemade chili . The Hawaiian could have been a tad sweeter but it was still delicious . The Angry Kimchi fries were also phenomenal . They topped these fries with tons of juicy bulgogi and spicy kimchi .

Lady hands me a spaceship beeper and we are lucky to score a just - abandoned table in the bar . Then things got a little awkward . 2002 R&B blasting on the speakers loud financial young bucks talking loudly in our peripherals . Not the ideal scene for a group of 50 + maritimers who unironically enjoy truck stop dining (which as an aside I also happen to enjoy A LOT) . However once some cocktails started flowing everyone got comfortable and perhaps I even saw some head - nodding to the beats Auntie Cynde? Anyway . Fast - forward 45 minutes later and we still have not been seated . No biggie but I went to ask for an ETA on our table . The hostess apologized and said it should not be much longer . Minutes later Mr . Manager himself came to apologize - insisted that he was working on getting us a table asap and PLEASE will we have some appetizers while we wait? He even kneeled down to our eye level . Real this - guy - knows - how - to - be - a - Manager type stuff . They whisked us off to a table and almost immediately filled our faces with apps (1 more than we ordered) . From then things were unbelievable . Our waitress was perfect - just chatty enough and checked in on us with just the right frequency . Mr . Manager would ensure everything was perfect even checking with the kitchen that the prime rib was to my Dad \"blue rare\" liking . (*shudder*) Just wonderful wonderful service .

And maybe just the fact that they have dosas made me delusional . I came here earlier in the week and ordered the spicy masala dosa . It came out in all it golden brown crepe - like goodness served with mint (?) chutney and lentil soup . I tore into it and boy was it good . I was eating bits of the crepe and dipping it in both the chutney and the soup . It had a bit of a kick to it ! Then I realized that I was not getting any \"masala\" part . I opened it and there was maybe two tablespoons worth of filling . Red flags should have been going up but I just kept eating and dipping . I was satisfied . I figured that since there was so little filling I was keeping my calorie count down for the day ! Bonus for me ! ! ! It cost about $9 for the dosa . I returned two nights later to pick up some takeout for dinner . I ordered the chicken tikka masala with rice AND naan . During the day they have a hot bar buffet going on which runs from 11 - 2 :30 . (When I went in earlier in the week - - I came in at noon and the buffet STILL was not ready - - by the time I left at 12 :30 - - it still was not there so who knows when it starts) I came in around 4pm . . . . the hot bar buffet had not been cleaned up and there were bins with the dredges (hardened and dried and OLD food that are left at the bottom) . I kind of look grossed out by what was left and the man (cook? waiter?) assured me there was food in the back . After I ordered he went into the kitchen and came back out with a plastic container of rice (which looked as if it was microwaved - - there were bubbles of moisture on the inside of the plastic . . . if it was fresh there would have just been cloudy steam . . . . these were water droplets already ! ! ) and some naan wrapped in foil . Then he took a takeout box and went to the hot bar and stirred up one of the containers (it was red and there was an oily lake of grease lying on top of it) and started to spoon it into a container . I was in shock that I could not speak . He remembered that I also ordered a mango lassi - - - he went over to the sliding door fridge and pulled out a pre - made lassi that for all I knew had been made yesterday ! Anyway it was $10 and all I could think was \"This cannot be good this cannot be good . \" Picked up my son from school went home and we sat down at the table . I unwrapped the naan and there was a huge hole in the middle (it was not a rip . . . it was a HOLE as if somebody had eaten it from the middle ! ! Plus it was hard as a rock) and as I put the first bite of tikka masala in my mouth I pulled out stems from some unknown herb . . . . . needless to say I could not did not even want to feed it to my son . I wound up throwing everything down the garbage disposal and warmed up last night leftovers of rice shake&bake chicken and heated up some corn .

UPDATEA lot has changed since my first visit to Crêpe Bar ! Most notably the new renovations which are amazing ! I have come so many times since I first found Crêpe Bar on Yelp in 2015 . I love trying their daily menu as well as their mainstays . I usually get the daily special AND the vanilla bean with strawberries .

Anyway I went to try the Crêpe Bar and it was closed . I guess they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays . I went back a few days later and was not even sure I was in the right place . I had seen so many pictures from Yelp I was expecting something with a bit more \"wow factor . \" The Crêpe Bar however is in the middle of a strip mall on the North West corner of Rural and Elliot . The inside was super busy and reminiscent of a hip European café . It was a little confusing at first how to order but obvious once you figure out their system . At the counter they have amazing homemade daily treats on display . When I checked in on Yelp I immediately won a free tea or drip coffee which was pretty cool . I ordered one of the meat crêpes and one of the dessert crêpes each visit . The first time I had the breakfast burrito crêpe and the vanilla bean with marinated strawberries (total under $15) . The second time I had the Papa K and maple butter with bananas brûlée (total under $20) . (see pics)The flavors of the mixtures were unbelievable . And the quality of the crêpes is outstanding : Light and flavorful . CONCLUSION The environment is small and unassuming but clean and a super cool place to have an amazing breakfast and hangout . 5 5 RECOMMEND OF NOTE*Hours :Wed - Sat 7am - 2pmSun 9am - 2pmMon Tues CLOSED*For more information : crepe - bar . com',\n",
       " 'This particular Keg location is a very reliable choice for a business meal (even at lunch) in Toronto Financial District . Food is delivered quickly it a nice and classy setting ambiance is super professional yet trendy and service is friendly and courteous . It also a nice setting for a date or even a get - together where you are aiming for a swanky yet conventional atmosphere . We visited specifically for a work lunch on a weekday and we were seated right away . Menus delivered within minutes and drinks delivered in a very timely manner . Food to table time was about 12 to 15 minutes and we were back at our desks in under an hour . Service was very respectful of our time and knew we did not want to stay very long . However this did not compromise the quality of our meal at all - the food was still very delicious well presented and well made . Their menu presents very dependable options that caters to a variety of people and tastebuds . While all Keg locations are not alike I was really pleased with this particular location and I would definitely come back - this spot is good for lunch dinner drinks and can absolutely be counted on as an old - faithful .

       " 'The Grand Canal Shoppes food court is somewhat always in a state of flux . The No1DP and I visit the Shoppes at least ever year for the last four years (partly because we end up staying at the Palazzo for his conference) and while we can count on staples such as Johnny Rockets Subway and Wasabi Jane there always one or two new business that open up that replaced the businesses that closed . Curry Pot was a new addition for this year . Their slogan is \"American made authentically Indian\" . While I have not eaten at enough Indian restaurants to make informed decisions about its authenticity what the No1DP and I can tell you that this was one of the better Indian places we tried . No1DP also picky about his Indian food as he can get a good plate back in Japan . He was initially hesitant about my choice because his stomach does not go well with bad Indian food but I had a good gut feel about this place . Considering the affluent environment of the Venetian|Palazzo complex it has to cater to a wide range of ethnicities . The menu options are more limited than traditional Indian curry houses but what is unique about this particular Indian joint is their limited South Indian options . Normally traditional curry houses are staffed by people from the northern part of India so you would not see masala dosa served here . CURRY POTS : Served with cumin - saffron basmati rice naan bread salad . - Chicken Tikka Masala (Chicken Creamy Tomato Sauce Red Chili Paste Herbs & Spices) - Classic Chicken Curry (Chicken Onion - Tomato Sauce Ginger - Garlic Paste Herbs & Spices $12)No1DP got the tikka masala while I got their classic curry chicken . As mentioned we enjoyed our plates because not only was it delicious but it was also one of the healthier options in the food court . We noted that the curries were at least moderately spicy (which we did not mind as we are used to moderately spicy) - we did not specify spice levels and we do not know whether this could be adjusted for people who cannot tolerate spicy food . Portions were quite big for a curry dish as there was a generous amount of chicken and a good amount of sauce for the \"naan\" . We could have ended up sharing a curry pot and it would have been adequate for lunch . We did note a few concerns with our dishes : - The \"naan\" that was served was actually pita cooked in the style of naan . Though it was still a good bread and went well with the curry sauce the business does advertise themselves as \"authentically Indian\" . I would think Indians would have an issue with this . - The salad contains too much onions . Needs more greens . I did not mind this as much as I love onions with my curry and it was sprinkled with cumin . - The No1DP ate one of the peppers and it was enough for him to be bothered by it for at least 5 minutes . As he somewhat lactose intolerant mango lassi was out of the question and had to get rid of the lingering spice with beer . Upon inspection I noticed there was quite a bit of green pepper seeds in the salad . Again I like my spice so this was not much of an issue but I do not know how a person with a lower tolerance of spice would handle it . Even with mild concerns the No1DP and I would come back here for a quick lunch should we be in the area . Hopefully this place does well enough so we could come back here again next year . I was bummed that I could not go back to Anchor Bar (last year food court lunch) so I hope tourists will be more open - minded to try food court Indian . ',\n",
       " 'The Geno Famous Cheesesteak was excellent . I m starting the review off with a 4 - star (yay i am a fan) but not because anything was wrong . . . I have only been in there once and have yet to try everything nor have I tried the delicatessen side of the board . If it as good as the cheesesteak was though . . . it will easily be a 5 . So the Geno Famous . I did not get any custom stuff just the way Geno wants it . It was excellent . The bread was very good too very soft and even the corners were baked right and not hard like others I have had in az . They do not use whiz which technically could be an issue for some but I m not getting into that argument because I m not from philly and I do not care . Some cheesesteak places pride themselves on it others have their own mix - it all good to me because I get to eat it all :) The onions were cooked very good real soft and tasty but did not take away from the meat . Speaking of the meat was very good like a distinct taste I cannot really put my head around just yet - I need another one to pin it down . But it was very good meat . So with all that said . . . the sandwich rocked - I will easily be back for sure . Venue . . . very clean in and out very visible location from Williams Field road north side . The girl actually spotted it the other night when we hit up the froyo place across the way . Walked in right up to the counter . Service was fast and cordial . Upon taking a picture (for yelp of course) a guy started talking to me whom seemed to be the owner perhaps? Nice guy asked what we ordered and suggested I tried some of their sauce . . . he made sure we got that added on the side before we left . . Not sure if he Geno but nice fella . Forgot to mention the fries . . . Fries either suck hard or their just good . These fries were just good and pushing damn tasty . . . I dont know if it the oil they use or some special seasoning (did not seem salty at all tho) but they were good . It on rare occasion that I finish a basket of fries . Overall I suggest you check it out . I m sure that was the best cheesesteak I have had in Arizona so I cannot wait to return and try another variant and see what they have to offer behind the deli because there needs to be some good lunch places out here in Gilbert . . . Geno is off to a great start . See you in there . ',\n",

       " 'No time to sit and eat a poki bowl? Well try the poki wrap . It the ultimate lunch on the go . Tastes just like the poki bowl without the need of utensils . The rice is already molded into flat square and placed on top of a seaweed sheet . Then they start adding the proteins and toppings as you select them . . . just like you would for a bowl . It is then rolled up and sliced in half just like a sandwich . It was surprisingly tasty . I tried their cooked salmon salad and tuna combo with various toppings . I chose the spicy house sauce and it went really well together . Highly recommend at least trying once . ',\n",
       " 'I did not have a good experience here . . . I understand that the whole idea of this restaurant is for the waiters to mistreat you and be jerks to you and your party but it just makes for an uncomfortable experience if you want to order something else or make any additional requests such as asking for an extra utensil or a drink refill . Our waitress took our orders and immediately ran off before we could decide on an appetizer . When she came back I told her we wanted to order an appetizer and she screamed at me saying I should have ordered \"like a big girl\" before she left the table . She did not even give us a chance to do this because she left so quickly ! Yes I understand being rude is their concept but there should be a certain point in which they still at least try to accommodate for their guests . The food is nothing to rave about either . Their menu does not have a lot of options besides a bunch of overpriced fried food . I ordered the half rack of ribs that came with fries and the fries were stale . The ribs were a bit dry and could have used more barbecue sauce . We also told our waitress that one of our friends in our party was celebrating his birthday and she yelled \"Nobody cares ! ! ! ! \" We thought they would do something humorous since it was his birthday but it went completely ignored . They did not do anything at all . I will never go back . . . . ',\n",

Actually the food was almost bad and the prices were out of control BUT the service was pretty good and the chips and salsa were amazing so there are your 3 stars . When you first walk in you will notice bowls of avocados sitting on your table . \"OMG ! I bet they make table side guacamole ! \" I exclaimed . Well they sure do . For $10 . Fuck that . $10 is too much for a tiny mini bowl of 2 avocados mixed with chili seasoning and onions . Unless I m drunk or really hungry which means I will buy anything . But I was not so I did not . No table side gauc for me . Next the main course . Everything on the menu is beef pork chicken or beef pork chicken and cream . What if you are not a huge fatty and CARE about your health? What if you want fresh fish or veggies or if you want your beef chicken pork without cream . I guess I should not have eaten that second bowl of tortilla chips huh? Now I am on a fat rant . So I order enchiladas - but for the love of god HOLD THE CREAM . The enchiladas were disappointing . I would give them a C + or maaaaaaybe a B - because they came on a bed of spinach . (interesting) . Maybe the cream would have saved them but I do not think it is necessary to add cream to make a good enchilada and neither do most Mexican restaurants with much better ones . The enchiladas were at most bland and blah and not worth $14 . I do not mind paying a lot for good Mexican Food but this was not very good . I was eating with fellow yelper Scott S . He had the chili relleno . He said is was below average . By the way their cheese enchiladas had CHUNKS of beef in the enchilada sauce . Mind you these are a separate menu items from the beef enchiladas . So your choices are :Enchiladas with beefEnchiladas with cheese and secret beef of which you become aware of after you bite inEnchiladas with cheese secret beef and creamBlech . Die . At least the iced tea was flowing and the chips and salsa were seiously kick ass . Hmm . . . if I was not in a generous mood I might be tempted to take away another star . But I wo not .

But as Josh Q says this Food Court is terrifying . The odd combination of overpriced fast food that is available in 99% of the rest of America for like 1000% less than is sold here is disgusting . After waiting in line for what felt like an eternity the less than chipper young chap takes my order of 1 carne asada taco 1 chicken asada taco and chips cheese . You know I m a high roller when I get the $3 . 00 taco ! I wait . . . and wait . . . . and wait . . . . food finally comes out . I was really hoping they were back there slicing the carne asada to perfection for my delicious feast I was awaiting . Turns out after one bite it was more suited for the little doggies in Mexico . On the first bite of taco #1 I cannot identify the meat which was room temperature . NO WAY it was steak ! It was a gelatinous square chunk . The texture was one that makes me cringe when thinking about . So I push the first to the side and ravenously bite into my second taco . . . chicken that should be better no? WRONG . Same texture different color . They must have some machine that is manufacturing meat pellets made with two different colors (yellow for chicken and brown for steak) . Even after a few glasses of champagne and feeling what I can only describe as Ethiopian hunger . . . I threw that nasty stuff away ! I could not even choke down 1 bite . YUCK ! Del Taco Mexican for \"Trash . \"',\n",
       " 'I m not sure why everyone is hating on this buffet . Maybe it because they paid full price? We got BOGO deal through MyVegas for dinner totaling $33 plus tips for the server and bartender . This is one of the only few buffets that have free alcohol (tap goose IPA bud light and three colors for wine) . There a separate station for all the different food themes . There was prime rib roast whole chicken kielbasa sausage shrimp and crab legs when we went . I love soup so I truly appreciated how each cuisines had one out two soups at their station . The sushi was not the best the rice was to mooshy and compacted . But I really enjoyed the inari kimichi edamame and cucumber salad . For Chinese the standout was the wonton soup ! Wow ! I also really liked the corn chowder from the Italian station . Remember to save room for dessert ! I wish I started from the dessert section . There was variations of cookies gelato station fresh fruits tarts creme brulees mini pies and beautifully designed pudding shooters ! Absolutely marvelous !

It seems that they raise the prices every January one penny (the nerve ! ) to keep up with inflation . So if you want to take advantage of this deal you have to get there . . . . Now ! Ok . Here the deal . You get one appetizer one entree and dessert for a mere 20 dollars and 12 cents at a high end restaurant . Where else can you do that? But I have to warn you . If you are not careful you may find yourself traveling too far into the future . For 1000 years more you can go for the grilled octopus but you wo not regret it . It was \"octopussylicious ! \" and for another few more years lets say 1500 you can enjoy a delicious Nova Scotian lobster pasta . I could not tell if it was really Nova Scotian but I did not really care I was not going to sleep with it anyways . The trick is (and very hard if I may add) is to stay in 2012 to enjoy the deal . I traveled too far into the future . By the time I realized it I was somewhere around 4512 I had to call Scotty to bean me up but all I can say is that food in the future is very delicious I enjoyed every bite of it . The service?

I will let you make that decision (one is far more likely than the other) . Something that I always fret about are serving sizes . Serve me a massive plate of food with only a little of what I ordered and like 90% rice wo not make me happy but serve me a dish with a generous helping of shrimp on a bed of rice and greens and I m a happy camper .

The smothered porkchop is a huge portion but I did not care for their gravy and that what makes or breaks the dish for me . Guess it a preference thing . I hear friends rave about their fried chicken but I m not a huge fan and have not tried it here .

Pssshaw . . . . \"mock\" chicken . I m just super excited about the fact that most of the bowls are gluten free except the Thai peanut . I got the coconut curry \"chicken\" and boy was it tasty ! They make it with tamari sauce instead of soy sauce hence the gluten free - ness of the dish . If I was not so full from the artichoke dip I would have devoured a soynami (vegan blizzard) .

Conveniently located inside of the Cosmopolitan EggSlut has found it home and in opinion there is no other better place for it to be then there . Ok with much anticipations I came before a concert with a hunger and a mission . With the Slut in mind I did not realized that they run out in the mornings with those . So we ordered the sausage egg and cheese and the burger sandwiches . To soon I got the cold brew which was amazing I added cream and sugar . The prices were a bit step but to my surprise the sandwiches were actually quit big . They both came on their signature Brioche buns that was warm and toasty slightly buttery and very good . The chicken Sausage was juicy and yummy . Topped with cheddar cheese and the runniest egg and a little bit if aoli or some sort of mayo it was the perfect sandwich . The burger was delish with a super juicy patty and sweet pickles to break up all the savory . It was a tasty surprise . All in all it was good filling and you gotta love the branding . I will probably come back for the \"Slut\" which I did not get to try but I do not know if I can pay the price on a daily . $30 something for 2 breakfast sandwiches and a ice coffee is pretty hefty for my budget .

       " 'Deep in the outskirts of Paris near the suburb of Bally off the cobblestone street leading from the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower there is a business serving pizza out of a window called La Pizza . A couple times in Paris I have paused along the cobblestone street to chow down some La Pizza . It is not the Eiffel Tower that attracts me to Paris at nighttime . It is the Billy Krauss rock n roll show at the nearby Napoleon Dueling Piano Lounge that leads me to Paris . The other night I needed an inexpensive and quick meal before showtime started at 9 o clock . The $9 . 99 two slices of pizza with a small fountain drink would do the trick just like it did a few years ago before seeing Bill and Dave perform . La Pizza shares a crowded cobblestone street with a few popular Parisan eateries : the crepe shop the Paris Buffet and J . J . Boulangerie . The upshot is that when I stand by La Pizza crowds of people surround me . Then when I bring my pizza inside J . J Boulangerie it is a challenge finding a table . La Pizza is the glorified pizza counter of J . J Boulangerie . The window counter feeds their customers into the crowded J . J Boulangerie creating a stress on finding a table . La Pizza is La decent . In my opinion La Pizza is better than Sam Club and far below New York pizza . Truthfully I appreciate Papa John and Little Caesar more . Disparate from other pizza places La Pizza has a special ingredient : the Paris motif . The Parisan environment is the topping on the pizza that creates a unique dining experience . It is amazing how much a well done theme improves the experience . If I were eating this ordinary pizza in a no frills brick & mortar shopping mall pizza joint or in a mall food court I would be like \"I spent $9 for a meal that is $2 . 50 at Sam Club? \" However in this Disneyfied Paris the theme envelopes my mind with all this Paris stimuli . Biting into this unremarkable I feel like I am biting into this remarkable Paris scene . Surrounding me are the Parisan pastries of J . J Boulangerie . My mind is so occupied with people watching the details of Paris and the up and coming show that I am not annoyed that the beverage is so small . Or I am not annoyed that they never gave me a napkin and I would have to walk back to the crowded pizza window . The theme and upbeat atmosphere takes me away from thinking that for a couple of dollars more that I could of ordered a personal pie and bottomless beverage at Grimaldi . La Pizza is a decent meal that could turn to extraordinary with a raspberry napoleon from J . J Boulangerie . Their raspberry napoleon is drop dead 5 star out of this world delicious that will elevate your taste buds higher than the Eiffel Tower . If you are in Paris and are decided on La Pizza I suggest leaving room for dessert . ',\n",

Another neat feature is an art installation by Miguel Rodriguez . You peer through curtained slots while sitting at a \"bar\" and it neon paint and objects against a black backdrop .

Complete with synthetic grass patio furniture fire pits additional cornhole games life - size jenga life - size beer pong bullet trailer and \"Cold Spike \" their ice skating rink . Admission is $10 and skate rentals are $5 but I read that this is an all - day price like The Cosmopolitan . The rink looked nice and it large compared to the others in town however I heard that it not really ice ! Which makes sense why they have not shut it down yet and have no plans on closing it for the season until they figure out their next move (the attendant shared that it possibly being converted into a roller rink) .

Friendly service great food (as always) and consistency will always keep me coming back to Chick - Fil - A . I even scored a free chicken sandwich coupon for doing their online survey . I love when my receipt has one of those on it ; - ) . Good times ! If I m ever on the 10 and want some tasty chicken nuggets I know where to come . ',\n",
       " 'I have no idea how this is possible but it appears that I m the first on Yelp to review The Root Cafe . Centered centrally in Lakewood I cannot imagine any reason why this place wo not catch on and build up a loyal following . Now . . . this is VERY important . . . I m giving it five stars but this is not an official \"Brandon Five Star Rating\" . They are getting an incomplete for now as they are eventually going to have food . . . but I could not see to it to give it four stars because the way the place looks its location the internal coolness and the fact that it not a chain puts it in a prestigious position with me . The chocolate chip cookie DID kick ass though . So . . . this was the Lakewood Phoenix moved a couple doors down into a bigger space . The Lakewood Phoenix aside from its name had no tie to Phoenix Coffee aside from using their product . And that they still do utilizing coffee beans roasted right here in Cleveland . I m all about the \"local\" so this is aces with me . The atmosphere is really nice with very high ceilings big front windows to people - watch or daydream out of . . . the walls are green and orange which nicely contrast the light wood floor . Exposed brick wood finishes and track lighting all come together to make the spot very inviting . The owners and baristas are all the same crew as the previous location so they are well aware on how to make coffee . I had my usual first - time - in - a - cafe fare a cappuccino and chocolate chip cookie . The drink was expertly made perhaps the best I have had in Cleveland served in a nice ceramic mug . Again cool . . . as I try to throw away as little as possible . Holy shite . . . I just asked the cute dark haired barista where they get the cookies as they are equally awesome (though . . a BIT expensive for their size . . . $1 . 75) . . . . . . THEY BAKE THEM HERE . RIGHT HERE . All their goodies are baked here except for the croissants . So if that any indication the food should be awesome . Actually . . . you know what? Screw it . This is being upgraded to a famous \"BRANDON S FIVE STAR RATING\" . So suck on that . (Hey . . . I m in a good mood . . . I got paid today forgot that I had not even deposited my last check and will possibly get to geek it out and play Dungeons and Dragons next week . . . so give me some slack)So that changes everything . I m writing this on their Wi - Fi it fast and easy to get on . Eventually they are going to have live entertainment as well . I will absolutely be back . . . this is definitely the most put - together cafe I have been to in Cleveland and given that it new it will have the momentum and drive to stay hot . Peace ! ',\n",
       " 'I am a sucker for a theme restaurant . I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick . When you arrive a nurse checks you in gives you a hospital wrist band and dresses you in a hospital gown . Seriously I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food . The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties french fries fried in lard shakes pure sugar coke and PBR . They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways . We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy ) all you can eat lard fries a vanilla shake full sugar coke and a PBR . The burgers were ordinary the fries were ordinary and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary . The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake . The bill came to around $30 which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food . Yeah yeah yeah I get it . It is a gimmick . Heart attack fat lard waitresses dressed as nurses cook dressed as doctors sugar beer . . . whatever . It gets old pretty fast . ',\n",
       " 'Chica is so nice I visited twice during Restaurant Week alone ! The former DB Brasserie space has a fun mix of seating areas furniture styles and textiles for a visually interesting space that also features multiple bar areas and grills where you can watch the food and drinks come together . Latin - inspired menu boasts hot and cold apps meaty entrees and a creative cocktail program . A dinner visit with friends allowed for sampling of several dishes and solidified plans to return for a lunch date . APPS : I know everyone goes ape for guac but the Mac and Queso is really the must - get option here with Peruvian corn baked in a parm cream gratin . It like a \"healthy\" mac and cheese due to the vegetables ! After having this the Grilled Corn Lollipops just did not stand a chance . The fresh ceviches (options for tuna or halibut) are small but solid with the empanadas arriving a bit overly charred and lacking moisture . The two apps I would most been looking forward to Grilled Octopus and Mushroom Quesadillas underwhelmed . The former threw me off visually by matching the protein portion with so many shishitos and a surprisingly peppery sauce that overshadowed the tough tentacles while the quesadillas were so thin as to prompt comments about whether the kitchen had forgotten the mushrooms and bleu cheese . The Chica fries were forgettable . MAINS : You gotta getta order of porchetta ! Crispy skin juicy and flavorful meat sided with yucca onion and brussels . This was a great dish but ask for a serrated knife because cutting through the skin was practically a workout in itself . Another standout is the Lemon Meyer rotisserie chicken (available by the half or whole) an explosion of juiciness and flavor paired perfectly with an herb chimmi churri . The Shrimp & Quinoa Cazuela was surprisingly good pairing of trendy grain plus lentils accented with cheese and several plump shrimp . Those favoring meat and potatoes will like the classic flavors of the Asado Negro Braised Short Rib which unfortunately does not photograph well but was extremely tender . The lunch sandwichito Cubano was okay ; a safe choice not a standoutDESSERTS : Both of the dinner options we tried were visually appealing but the Tres Leches was the favorite with a toasted meringue topper . The Venezuela Marquesa cake was nicely chocolatey with subtle coffee notes but not served with the crema ice cream I would looked forward to . Lemon Bunelos from the lunch menu are tasty even without the berry and dulce dips but not something I would get again . Service was friendly from bar to table and attentive both for visits . Notably the sommelier took the initiative to come over after noticing Kevin L checking out the drink menu and his suggestions were spot - on for the requested flavor and budget preferences ! I enjoyed Chica finding it to be a great improvement over the previous restaurant . My only concern about dining here was the volume : it noisy with all hard surfaces and much conversation had to be repeated or kept to those immediately adjacent which is problematic for both group dining or a date night . Ultimately I have to agree with Rod U who declared this place \"impressive and fun\" ! ',\n",
       " 'This is the holy grail of restaurants for parents . . . a place that is kid - friendly AND has good food . I did not think it was possible . Based on all the family - friendly spots we have been to this one has the best food . Now I do not think it on par with elite restaurants on the Strip but it still very tasty . What really makes this place special is the value - - a happy hour (from 4 :30 - 6 :30) where appetizers wine and cocktails are $5 and Kona pale ale is $3 . They also have a three course prix - fixe menu for $35 . The mixed green salad ($7 . 95 and not on the HH menu) was respectable although not the sexiest dish . Both the tempura crusted spicy ahi roll and crunchy lobster potstickers were delicious fusion options worth getting again . The wagyu sliders (2 per order) were tender and juicy and sat on a pretzel - like bun . They were accompanied by garlic sweet potato fries . The biggest letdown was the salt and pepper crisped calamari . While the sweet and spicy flavor was enjoyable and the addition of macadamia nuts was a nice contrast in texture it was a heavy dish that could have benefited from having the sauce on the side . The kid menu is not cheap - - at $13 - - but it does come with three courses . The appetizer is a cheese quesadilla with sliced apples celery and carrots . There are six kid entrees to choose from . The final course is either a sundae or fresh fruit (guess which one my kid chose) . Another pleasant surprise was the quality of service . From the host and hostess to our waiter and food runners . . . everyone was warm and welcoming . It almost commonplace to walk into a \"nice\" restaurant with a child and suffer poor service from employees who do not want you there . So getting the kind of attention and friendliness that we received was shocking . That level of care will turn us into repeat customers as there no doubt we will be back whether or not it for a family night out or a date night . ',\n",

No one is forcing them to do business with Groupon it is their choice . First experience : Came in and there was a large group dining . Server ignored me for several minutes then said they would be unable to help me for nearly an hour because the large party had just ordered . How unprofessional . Second experience : Went in to order takeout placed order for $30 worth of food to meet their $10 card minimum . Cashier refused to accept my Groupon for takeout order even though it does not state dine in only anywhere in the fine print . She walked away as I was talking to her - I assumed she went to get a manager but when she returned she simply ignored me until I asked to speak to management . Then she twirled around in a circle and facetiously chirped at me HI I M MANAGER HOW CAN I HELP YOU?She then straight up told me to call Groupon for a refund because she was not going to accept it and walked away again turning away my business . Thoroughly unprofessional . EDIT : They now have another location a block up the same street . Service is much better there . ',\n",

Have we rebelled against our very nature?Putting that aside the good news is that I ended up at Green and it was delicious . The Thai Peanut bowl was seriously delicious - great peanut taste coupled with that coconut milk balance and a little zang of spice with perfectly cooked noodles . The \"mock\" chicken was whatever the texture always gives it away for me . They also have a great selection of beverages of the healthy variety and some fresh juices that were also quite delicious .

       " 'If you have not dined here you are certainly missing out - yeah you ! They whip up Peruvian food with immense love and flavor ! They have the most incredible Lomo Saltado I have ever had . Steak and potatoes elevated to new heights ! They make it with tenderloin strips sauteed onions and tomatoes plated over french fries and rice soaking in all of the delicious brown stir - fry sauce . This is a winning combination ! We added a few dashes of salt and it really woke up the entire dish . Flavor rating : 5 5The Lomo Saltado is served with their house green \"aji\" sauce and baby that sauce is to die for ! ! It slightly spicy very smooth herbaceous and somewhat tangy . It brought so much life to the table ; it was incredibly fresh and vibrant ! This is one of the best versions I have ever tasted . You know I asked for multiple refills - heck I can see myself dipping a boot in that sauce and enjoying it . Flavor rating : 5 5We also tried the Papa A La Huancaina which is boiled potatoes swimming in a rich and creamy yellow sauce called Huancaína . It comes garnished with some black olives and a hard boiled egg slice . As we never had this dish before my fiancé and I thought the boiled potatoes were too simple but the cream sauce was truly excellent . Flavor rating : 4 5The portions are large and ideal for sharing . We left completely satisfied and stuffed with a large doggy bag with leftovers of both dishes . ',\n",

If you have a crack habit I m pretty sure it baked into the delicate double - layer fruit Pavlova . This is also the only place you will find macarons the size of your palm - higher price lessened opportunity to try multiple styles but the flavors are spot - on ! The popular ginger - fig has been a bit elusive but the strawberry - lemonade has ample balanced notes of each plus a smear of jam in the middle . Everything in the cases looks like a work of art . On the downside they are priced like art too - $5 . 25 macaron $7 for that tiny but tasty Pavlova . Great spot for a special occasion like a Girls Night Out or a birthday meetup with friends but not an easy spot to visit regularly . ',\n",
       " 'Bellagio Buffet overall has 4 - star food . . . but for a buffet I consider it a 5 - star buffet given it is MUCH cheaper than Bacchanal ($38 person as opposed to $57 person) and the food here for the most part is pretty darn good . Service usually is not great at buffets but we had excellent service here . Waited about 1 hour and 20 minutes in line before we got seated on a Wednesday night . Crab legs gaLORE ! Although I found it strange how some of the crab legs were left whole and some were cut in half . Unfortunately there were a mixture of good legs and bad legs . . . but the majority of them were good and sweet . My fellow cheap Asians are always crowding around the crab legs . It a little irritating when one person holds up the line by standing there for several minutes being picky about her legs . Prime rib was so on point I got 2 servings . The pizza was surprisingly really good . . . I m ashamed to say I ate 3 slices when I could have saved room for other things . Bellagio Buffet has a much wider selection of pastas compared to other buffets I have been to . I really enjoyed all the pastas on top of my 3 slices of pizza . I definitely carb loaded here . The Chinese section was mediocre . Very average dumplings . . . and I would pass on the wonton soup . Japanese sushi section had much higher quality raw fish than Bacchanal ! I was very pleased with the hand rolls ahi poke and salmon poke . The desserts were so cute and delicious . Flan creme brûlée eclairs SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM and so much more ! I m just a huge fan of soft serve ice cream and prefer it over gelato . ',\n",

I like the interior I like what they have on the menu I like how it clean and I like how the employees are super friendly . But how can someone run a restaurant and not be able to keep simple functions of the store maintained?I came to try the curry with pork cutlet but the first time I came their fryer was not working so everything I wanted could not be made . Well fine . So I ordered the curry with sausages . Of course the presentation was nice but I got 3 small sausages with lots of curry and not enough rice . I decided to give this place another chance because determining something of what it is with one experience does not provide fair justice . So I came again today with a friend . The minute we walk in the employee notifies us that they do not have anymore curry . . Uhhhh well My friend just decided on an omelette rice instead but apparently the certain rice they use for the omelette rice was not available either . In the end he ordered a spaghetti dish with a fried egg on the bottom called the Neopolitan . The employee brings over a free chicken salad to apologize for everything but I felt like it was in vain . The food is good but the business seems unstable . Whatever the case is I will just stick to Curry Zen . ',\n",
       " 'They claimed on their website that they have \"the best wings in town\" . As a seeker of good wings let me tell you about my adventure with this place . Everything started fine with our order of 24 wings with three separate sauces for 3 eaters . The wings arrived exactly an hour later with the exact number of wings promised and a side of celery . Here the catch . . . THERE WAS NO SAUCE ! My party of three decided to just tough it out and eat the wings plain . They were I kid you not so bland that I was not sure what I was eating . They literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us . So once we realized how unbearable the plain wings were we called and complained about the sauce . About 40 minutes later the sauce arrived . At this point the wings got cold and our hunger turned into an unbearable rage . We tried BBQ Garlic Parmesan and Spicy . The sauces were just average . The spicy sauce was so weak that I should have just settled with a bottle of sirracha . The deliver guy gave us a cannoli as an apology . . . . ONE CANNOLI . . . . 3 eaters ! You get the point . But this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was . The outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little . It looked nice but did not taste that great . So after 1 hour and 40 minutes 24 wings 3 sauces and a cannoli . . . we have 3 very unhappy customers . The wings were the most mediocre wings I have ever tasted . I will NOT order here again for the wings NOR will I recommend it to the fellow wings connoisseurs out there . Final verdict : MOST MEDIOCRE wings in town ! ',\n",
       " 'About a 2 - 2 . 5 : Romados is a Portuguese bakery and grilled chicken place that is considered to offer one of the best grilled chicken in the city of Montreal . The menu offers different parts of the chicken as family packs or as combos coming with a bed of rice fries a side of salad as well as a large bread . You can opt for the chicken to be picy or are gular which is a brushing of a sauce . The hubs and I shared a 1 4 white - meat chicken combo which came with a breast and thigh . I was slightly disappointed as the chicken itself did not look like how many had described it to be with the skin being nice and crisp . It was definitely juicy but it was lacking in the flavors as even the auce did not help much . I m sure you could request for some extra sauce on the side or some extra brushing but I was not much of a fan of the sauce any way . The bread I did not care for as it was pretty dry . Service was super friendly and there limited seats within . Just note that there are 2 lines - one for walk - ins (on the left) and one for call - aheads (on the right) . + friendly staff + complimentary bread with meal + juicy chicken but still flavorless (?)',\n",

Depending on the time and day inside can get crazy busy and I m used to that so it does not bother me if I end up getting my order to - go or not . The line can get long but it moves fairly quick . There are 3 different sandwiches on the menu I like so I am glad that they have kept them over the years . Problem is the prices and consistency of the food has changed . I used to pay $8 . 95 for a sandwich that currently costs $12 . 95 and is not as big as it was before . That or the amount of meats are off . For example when I get a sandwich that has 3 different types of meat on it they put a thin layer of pastrami on the bottom and then a huge amount of turkey . I post pictures each visit and you can clearly see how they are not consistent with amount of meat they put on each sandwich . When I told the guy working this last visit what type of sandwich I wanted on a French roll he said that he would not recommend that type of bread with that sandwich . I explained that I had ordered it many times before on that type of bread and would prefer it please . He made it the way I ordered it and the sandwich came out tasting great ! The meat had good flavor and it was tender and juicy and it still carved in front of you . I still give 4 stars even with the meat portions being off because the meat here is excellent . I only wish that if they are going to raise the prices that they not put less meat on the sandwiches as well coleslaw or at least when they do pile the sandwiches high they should put equal amounts of each meat . They do still have soup and for beverages hey have water juice beer and soda . ',\n",

The spacious and casual interior was conducive for small and large group gatherings . For some reason we were the only diners in a sizable restaurant during these visits . Given the subdued atmosphere it was difficult to get excited for an excitable cuisine when the food was this poorly put together . The Roti Canai ($3 . 95) was the highlight of the meal . The Roti was warm soft crisp fluffy flaky and thick enough to soak up the bowl of spicy chicken curry . The side of curry was complex nicely balanced between sweet and spicy flavors . Additionally the embedded chicken and potato were nicely simmered and flavorful . Very tasty I really enjoyed it . The Hainan Chicken ($7 . 50) was made with steamed chicken layered on soy sauce rice seasoned with chicken fat and a side dish of sweet red chili . The chicken tasted very bland heavily dependent on the two sauces for seasoning . There were also more bones than meat in the chicken making this dish difficult to eat and to complement the aromatic flavors stemming from the rice . It was off putting and I was underwhelmed . Equally underwhelming was the Nasi Lemak ($8 . 50) that came with coconut - flavored rice chicken fried anchovies cucumber slices and hardboiled egg . For some reason there were no shrimps in the dish even though the menu suggested that it would be included . The chicken was spicy but overcooked . The salty - sweet - spicy anchovies were the only item that nicely accompanied the coconut - flavored rice . Service was very pushy as we were encouraged to order their Lobster Special on several occasions . We came with so much anticipation but find the food and service to fall below expectations . Completely underwhelmed and unsatisfied . We will not be coming back . ',\n",

The ceilings are unbelievable filled with paintings and not to mention all of the detail that goes into the molding . But back to the Gondola ride a quarter - mile Grand Canal flows through the hotel past the piazzas and shops . All the mean time the rest of the crowd gets to watch you or ignore you because they are too vested in the 80 international boutiques and name brand outlet stores . Cobblestone pathways filled with street performers to entertain you and then at the end you find yourself in a large room with painted floor to ceiling walls to give that impression of being in Venice . In here you will find multiple restaurants and more street performers to make that dinning experience so much more enjoyable . There is nothing like the Venetian unless maybe Venice herself . Speaking of restaurants the Venetian is filled with the best fine dining you can experience on the strip and equally with the shows (A Bronx Tale Phantom Blue Man Group Jersey Boys comedy acts like Wayne Brady and David Spade) . It is also home of the Madame Tussaud wax museum . The service is always top notch and the suites are memorable . If I could I would always stay here ! ',\n",
       " 'Who took 3 showers a day while staying at the Venetian Suites? I DID . yes i took THREE showers in ONE DAY . i could not help myself . i felt so spoiled and pampered during my stay because my suite included THREE flat screen TVs - - 1 TV by the beds 1 TV in the living room and 1 little TV in the bathroom . The bathroom was bigger than my bathroom at my own house ! It had a separate door for the toilet (for privacy) bath & glass shower with the BEST shower head . No wonder i took three showers in one day . My friends and i reserve 2 Bella Suites in the main Venetian building ($259 a night) . 5 people in each room and each of us had our own bed . The sofa can pull out as a sofa bed and there were two queen beds . However i was kinda disappointed the room didnt have a coffee maker for me to boil hot water or anything . The suite also included two bathrobes for you to wear and if you like to keep them they were $80 each . If you plan to stay at Venetian try booking your room in the main building rather than the Venezia because my friend said it was inconvenient and he took at least 3 elevators to reach the main casino floor . The customer service at the bell desk was very attentive and i did not have to wait long to check in . I enjoyed my stayed at the Venetian and i would love to stay here again . I cant wait to check out the new Barneys ! Tip : if you are a quest at the hotel you can get into the Tao for free without lining up in the main line . theres a separate line for hotel guests . :)',\n",
       " 'Hot dogs are my jam I can eat hot dogs anytime of the day when I m traveling I will buy a hot dog and take a couple of bites even if I have just eaten just for the love of hot dogs . When I read about The Chili Man I could not believe I did not know about him ! I once was lost but now I m found . Weekdays (except Monday) you can find The Chili Man food cart parked in front of BofA and Chima on Tryon . He is serving up delicious hot dogs with homemade chili slaw mustard and spicy ketchup . I would recommend going with someone so you can order three or four and cut them in half so you can try different styles ! ! Food cart canned soft drinks chips . ',\n",
       " 'I wish there was a way to give half stars on Yelp so I rounded up to 4 stars . Do not come here for the ambience (3 5) cause that is not what you will get . It is a small strip mall type store so very small and vanilla inside . The food this go round was decent but some of it was a bit off . I had the general tso chicken which was very good (5 5) but the fried rice did not taste as fresh as before and could have used more soy sauce to up the saltiness (2 5) and the egg roll was not good (1 5) the cabbage tasted too raw and so it was too cabbage tasting as a result . Still we will come again as it is overall good and the portions are huge . ',\n",

       "'I love chinese food and I love mexican food . What can go wrong? A couple of things . First things first this place is more of a \"rice bowl\" kind of place . I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats . The ordering was a little confusing at first but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2 - item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk) . I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side . I m gonna admit this place looks kinda dirty . I do not think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside i would give it a \"C\" grade lol . We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food . We took it to go and ate at our hotel room . Mmmm . . . the food was just alright . The jade chicken was nothing special . It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken sesame chicken variant . The hengrenade chicken although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken was still pretty spicy for me . Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy . If you are not sure ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering but it was way too spicy for me . The jade chicken quesadilla was decent but nothing special . Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese . A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald apple pie . If you order the burrito be warned that it a burrito for gnomes and smurfs but he said it was tasty . They provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent again nothing special . Not gonna lie the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside . I used the bathroom like 5 times . I do not recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day . '"
